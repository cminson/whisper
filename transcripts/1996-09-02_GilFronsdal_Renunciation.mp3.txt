 So, it's nice to be here. We're a smaller number today, I guess, because of the holiday, but more people than I thought came. I've said this many times before, I'm often surprised when I open my eyes and see how many people are here after I've called. Let's see. So, what I had in mind today was if I can manage not to talk so much, is to talk just a little bit, kind of set a theme, and then have more of a discussion or have some kind of discussion some way or other, if that's agreeable with all of you. And what I wanted to do, kind of the theme that's been on my mind since yesterday, is the theme of renunciation. So, I'll start off by reading this quote or poem by the Buddha from the Dharma Pada. And you can have this kind of in the back of your mind as we go through this. So, the Buddha said, if by giving up a limited happiness, one would see abundant happiness, let the wise, beholding abundant happiness, give up the limited happiness, the limited pleasure. So, would you be willing to give up a limited pleasure for happiness, for an abundant happiness? So, I went up yesterday to visit Ajahn Amaro. Ajahn Amaro, Ajahn means teacher, and Amaro is the monk's name of an English man who was ordained as a Thai monk. He's a student of disciple of Ajahn Sumedho. And he's in from the Theravada tradition. He's kind of in our wider tradition. He's part of our family. And he's just started a monastery up in Yukaya, in Redwood Valley. They have about 250 acres up there. And there's now two monks and several lay people and a postulant, a man who was planning at some point becoming a monk. And about five of us went up to visit them and had a meeting with them and look around. And it's a beautiful piece of property. It's kind of in this hillside, this forested hillside. They're forest monks, so they got themselves a forest. It's convenient. And it's this madrone oak, chaparral poison oak kind of vegetation. And two of us came late, so we missed a walk. They just went for a three-hour walk around the property, coming back, talking about all the poison oak they walked through. And they pulled out the tech-new, and we're trying to get it off. And it's kind of going to be, I think, probably a thriving monastic center here in California. Ajahnamara is a wonderful teacher. He's going to come and teach for us here in Palo Alto in January for one day sitting. And in some ways, the Theravada Buddhism as a wider religious tradition than just Vipassana, monasticism is one of the important elements, the big puzzle, the mandala of what the scene is like. Not that any of us, not that it's expected that any of us will become monks, but it's part of the mandala of the tradition. And so we were up there talking about all kinds of things. And at some point he started praising the virtues of monasticism. After all, he's a monk. He loves what he does, and so he loves talking about it, I guess. And he was talking about monasticism in a sense. Part of it is like it's an archetype, or part of it is being a monk or a nun. There's a part of each of us that has a monastic streak, or there's a monastic aspect he said to every human being. And there's many other aspects also, but it's one part of who we are. It's not that we have to turn that into being a monk or a nun, but it's part of who we are, is a monastic side. And so, and he talked about how, for him, that living the monastic life was not giving up all kinds of wonderful things, but for him it was giving up of limited happiness for abundant happiness. And that there's a certain way, he talked about the life force, that the life force that curses through us, that we're somehow responsible for, how it gets channeled through us, that for him the life force was channeled most efficiently, most beautifully, most virtuously, most as it should be, in the form of monasticism. And that whatever streak we have within us that's monastic is one of the streaks, one of the ways in which this life force can go through. So he was kind of switching back and forth between that something all of us have that's beautiful and should be tapped into from time to time, and something that you can actually do as a form, you can become a monk or a nun, and it's a really beautiful thing to do. And in the Buddhist tradition, the theme, also renunciation, is then a big part usually of becoming a monk. The word for renunciation in Pali, nakkama, comes from the root of the word to leave home, or to leave, or to depart. Home-leaving is what used for describing becoming a monk or a nun. And part of the other side often of renunciation is the idea of contentment, being content. And renunciation should be a life of contentment, of going towards contentment, should arise out of contentment rather than rising out of discontentment and therefore reacting or responding to discontentment and going from one life of discontent to another life of discontent, a greater life of discontent. And it's an interesting question to explore, how much of our life is run by discontent? Are you discontented with your life in some ways? Are you discontented with parts of your life of who you are? Is that discontentment then responsible for certain decisions you make for what you do with your time and people you're involved in, the work you do? And I think that in the Vipassan tradition in the West, we're a lay tradition. Most of the students are lay, most of the teachers are lay. And so we don't talk much about things like renunciation or letting go so much or surrender or sacrifice or disenchantment or monastic life itself. And so it might be interesting just to look a little bit at why we don't talk about these words that are words that are a little bit more popularly used in the tradition than we hear in the West. And part of it I think is because it was a little bit offensive to some of our ears. I sat up here every Monday evening and talked renounce, renounce, renounce. You know, there are only a few diehards left. I'll be talking to myself. But it seems to be offensive or disagreeable to many of us to our Western sentiments. And I think there's a kind of strong feeling in the West, kind of affirmation of life or America, the pursuit of life, liberty and happiness. It's like God-given right that we all have. And anything that's going to get in the way of my pursuit of life, liberty and happiness is, what's the word in English? Anatomy? Anatoma. Is that the right word? Yes. And so get out of my way. So renunciation, that seems kind of frightening to this idea of, that's a firm life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Or, you know, it seems dangerous. You can't get to what you deserve then. That's the latest version of that. Life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and give me what I deserve. So it kind of rings a little bit against some of the undercurrents of how Americans want to kind of American philosophy, American views and values. But I think because of that, I think it's often interesting to look then at the underside of that or the shadow side of that. Why is this reluctance to somehow talk about renunciation and letting go or surrender or monasticism or whatever? Maybe you haven't felt it, but I feel, I felt this renunciation, this kind of hesitation or this, it's disagreeable to bring this up too much. Now it occurred to me recently that many of the Posna students in the West end up living monastic lives, but they don't know it. And we don't tell you. We don't tell you, you know, come sign up for a 10 day retreat and do a 10 day monastic retreat where you become a monk for none for 10 days. You take vows of celibacy for 10 days. You eat only what's pretty much given you for 10 days. You don't have to choose your food. You follow the schedule. You have to keep silence. It's basically monastic life and you have to come to a monastery usually to do it. Usually monasteries, we do the retreats. And so we don't say, you know, sign up for the, you know, come be a nun or a monk for 10 days. I don't know. Maybe none of you would go. We say, come to do a Vipassana retreat, you know, and be with your favorite teacher and have a nice time. But, but it's, you know, a lot of that has to do with words and the words we choose to describe things. You know, it's many different ways of describing the same thing. Maybe instead of renunciation, we can talk about simplicity and then people would perk up a little bit more rather than kind of, you know, if I say renunciation, the energy drops. But simplicity, that seems okay. So partly it's a choice of words, but you know, we, we, we, you know, so I think one of the forms that American Vipassana practice is taking because it's so lay centered is that actually we go back and forth between temporary, temporary monastic practice, temporary monasticism, and then living our practice in daily life. And it, and it works very well to kind of go back and forth. And, but you don't have to think about it being monastic if you don't want to. So it also is where this disenchantment is another word that's kind of key to the Buddha, to the Theravada tradition and disenchantment, Jesus, you know, I don't want to watch, you know, that sounds kind of world renouncing or world disaffirming. I don't want anything to do with disenchantment. I want to be enchanted. But so I want to give two examples, one dramatic and one more subtle. And the dramatic one I just make up, but you know, we all know maybe living examples. You know, the Silicon Valley executive who works 80 hours a week and has a car and three cellular phones, probably two cars, probably has a Lexus in it, you know, and you know, and has, you know, has several houses and has a nice husband with many kids and has, you know, all everything, right? This doesn't have herself. Because you're working so hard trying to do all these different things, reaching out, grabbing, trying to have everything, trying to have too much. Now, someone who's living that life and constantly pursuing money and more money to have more things and all that stuff and jockeying it all, if that person was disenchanted with their life, we'd be kind of happy to hear that. You know, we're all kind of disenchanted, I think, with that kind of life already. It doesn't seem interesting to us, that kind of intense kind of life of greed and having more and success and working hard, I suspect. So, you know, so I've heard, I've talked to people, you know, who've renounced the life of Wall Street. They've been in the financial world for a number of years and renounced it. Enough of this is killing me. And so they go off to find something else, a life of renunciation. They said, you know, life of simplicity. But it doesn't matter how we choose the words, perhaps. So the more subtle example. So we were up there visiting Ajinamuro and part of the scene around monks, monks and nuns aren't allowed to go out and buy their own food. They're not allowed to store their own food overnight. They're not allowed to cook their own food. So whatever food they're going to eat that day has to be given to them. And so usually if they're in a place where it's appropriate, they go walking for an alms round carrying their bow. But up there in Redwood Valley in Yukaya, you know, they're going to have to walk for a long time. So what happens is that when lay people come to visit the monastery, one of the things then, you know, the lay people are concerned, these monks, the monks up there, there's no nuns right now. So they're concerned, these monks, you know, they should survive somehow. So you want to want to bring them some food. So there's a whole thing we need to bring food and you serve them their meal and they have their meal. And it's very nice ceremony. It's nice to support them. And so the five of us all brought food and I brought a lot of food, but I didn't cook anything. It was particular to that meal. I brought three melons, which could have been cut up and offered for that meal, but they couldn't be kept for the next day because the monks can't store food, but the lay people who are there, they can store the food and then serve it to the monks the next day. So I bought these melons, I brought a whole bunch of apple juice, I brought these boxes of crackers and spaghetti sauce, things that, you know, didn't have to be eaten that day. So I just brought it, you know, I didn't think about too much, I gave it to the kitchen and so they have it there. So it's time for the meal and there are all these dishes that everybody had brought. And then they had this custom up there of when they offered a dish, the main cook who in the kitchen, she would announce who that dish was from. So, you know, my dish was nowhere to be seen. My melons hadn't been cut up and so like, oh, you know, everybody else having their name announced, they made this donation and Gil, you know, what a miser. And then at some point in the middle of the meal, I'd come with this woman and so the middle of the meal, the cook said, the person said, and now this, you know, this dish comes from Nancy and Gil. And I just say, well, actually, no, I didn't announce the fact that actually it didn't come from me. So, you know, here I was, you know, so these thoughts, you know, oh, you know, now they're going to think I'm a miser and, you know, I'm not so generous. I don't know the scene. I've been a monk myself. I should have known. And they probably think maybe I don't respect them enough and I'm just, or I'm freeloading. I'm getting, because afterwards you get to eat whatever's left over and there's just like lots of food. So, so it's like, so you get them freeloading, you know, they're gonna think all these terrible thoughts of me and see me terribly. And I, you know, maybe I should say something, you know, and I should make an ounce. Well, you know, actually I brought these melons and admirals, you know, and, but then like here, but I brought things just to make sure they, be sure they knew. And so I wouldn't, you know, so, so they would have the right image, right image on me. Right. So I'm sure that none of you kind of really understand how it's a dilemma of self image and protecting it and putting it out there. But anyway, there I was in this world wondering what, you know, this is awkward. So, you know, it was a little bit more subtle than working 80 hours a week and pursuing lots of money or whatever, but it's kind of pursuing something similar. So that at some point I noticed it well enough. This is ridiculous. And so I renounced it. I gave it up. I surrendered that, you know, not big, I surrender not because, not so much because it was silly, but I surrender because it wasn't who I really am, who I really was. It wasn't really, it wasn't really expressing the deeper sense of contentment, of fullness, of openness to the world, of non-protectedness or non-defensiveness or non-projectioness that I feel is who I really am. You don't have to be anybody to be a great person. Isn't that great? Isn't it a relief? So I could just start renouncing, in that situation, renouncing and settling back into this being that didn't have to be anybody. And it was kind of a great relief. So there are two kinds of renunciation. There's that kind of renunciation, which is a release. We've got a release of all those things that keep us from our contentment, keep us from our wholeness. It's a kind of a renunciation that reveals the maybe the luminous quality of our life, luminous quality of awareness or presence itself. It's the release of those things which gets in the way from us being the best person that we could be. And isn't that great to announce the things that keep us in the way of letting us be the best person we can be? It seems like a nice thing to do. The other kind of renunciation is that which diminishes our life. You renounce something and it diminishes the quality of our life. It hurts us in some way, hurts our inner sense of integrity. So it can augment our integrity or it can decrease it. And it's for us to decide what is appropriate in this situation. I think of renunciation not to get away from something, but to get into life more fully. There was another monk I talked to at one point who talked about the value of massicism. You live this worldly life and you have to go shopping and cooking and make money and pay mortgage and do all this stuff and your life is just a mess and it's complicated. And you have a monk and people cook for you, they bring you food and you just hang out and it's just very simple and it's very nice. You don't have to think about all these problems. And you really focus on your spiritual life. And that's one way of thinking about it. But there's another way also of thinking about it. And that is cooking and shopping and paying your mortgage and all these things. Rather than getting rid of them, maybe there's a way of renouncing a certain attitude we have about them that allows us to enter into more fully so it becomes as much of a monastic practice as sweeping the temple. The monks, they're sweeping the temple all the time. They're sweeping the temple all the time. They didn't think that sweeping a temple got in their way. Why should washing dishes or going shopping get in your way? It has to do with an attitude of what you bring, how you bring to it. And if we're trying to do 20 things at once, maybe then it's too much. Maybe renunciation then is at least do two things, if not just one. Renunciation is simplifying our life enough just to be able to be there fully and make this a practice, make this a place where we enter into life rather than make us fragmented. So I looked up renunciation today in the dictionary to look at the mythological root. And so the re part means like back. But the enunciation part is like the word announce or enunciate. It means to tell, to speak. And so it's to speak back or to repeat, I guess, or re say. And there's something about saying that comes with renunciation, at least in the classic. Have you ever noticed the kind of release that can come when you're honest? You say something, you say your truth to someone or to yourself, and it can feel as a release in your body. You know, to renounce allows for a certain kind of release. And I think that healthy renunciation requires a kind of truth saying, a kind of honesty about what's going on, who we are. And you need to be extremely honest for renunciation to be an appropriate thing in our life. Sacrifice literally means, this Latin word literally means to make sacred. You know, if you go to your corporation and work and your boss says, well, you have to sacrifice for your job and work a few extra hours today. Is that making sacred? Maybe, depends again, your attitude. But I think we use the words, sacred, sacrifice is lost its original meaning. But is there sacredness in your life? And is there some way you can sacrifice, make sacred? Is there some way we can renounce or give up, give up, originally meant to offer up, so that if something becomes sacred or connects us to what's sacred, rather than becomes a kind of diminishment of who we are. So what can we renounce? And classic things like material gain, goods, possessions, self-importance. We can renounce the urge to dominate others. We can renounce the need to control others. We can renounce the need to be effective or to be in control. We can renounce the need to be right. Wouldn't that be relief? If all of us renounce the need to be right, you can still be right. But renouncing the need to be right, right? We can renounce our hesitation. We can renounce our fear. We can renounce all our excuses. What about that? So to renounce. And then we can renounce our self-concepts. So my image of myself as being the most generous person in the world, I had to renounce that image. Why bother having it? Why bother having it? So maybe that's enough so we can have some discussion. Suzuki Roshi said, renunciation is not giving up the things of this world, but accepting that they go away. Isn't that something? Accepting they go away. And the other side of renunciation is contentment. A content person is not concerned with building up possessions or building up a self-image with reputations. A content person doesn't interact with those kinds of needs. The content person doesn't try to control the situation, control other people. So we can start with contentment or discontentment, if that's what's going on. It's very important to start with discontentment. What is it like to be content in one's body, to have physical bodily contentment? If we use our body as a standard and say, well, I'm going to live a life, at least my body is content, it's very hard to have our minds racing along at 100 miles an hour doing 100 different things at once. The body is a great truth-telling device. So to ask yourself, do I have a content body? Or discover some modicum of contentment perhaps in your meditation practice or some other activity that you do. To take that very seriously and use that contentment as not something to judge yourself by, but rather as a reference point to notice when you lose your contentment, to what causes the loss of contentment, and what helps you become more content in a holistic way, in a useful way. So, yes. Q When you were listening, a number of things about self-image, a lot of them seem to be ideas, and then you said fear. So that sounds like a totally different kind of thing and much harder to me now. A Yes. But sometimes we can, and sometimes it may be appropriate. Sometimes you can see something like fear and you can struggle for years, you know, figuring it out and trying to do something, trying to cope with it or whatever. And sometimes, I'm not saying always, but sometimes it's possible I should give it up. Q So what you were saying earlier about, you didn't use the words letting go, but giving something to me. A Yeah. Letting go, renunciation, surrender. Q Instead of giving up. A Giving up, simplifying yourself. A lot of has to do with words, so it's a matter of finding the right word for you. Q But asking your question about fear, this is changing a little bit, but I had a friend who went to her meditation teacher and kind of was complaining, I guess, a little bit about how difficult her life was and how she was doing so many different things. And I'm feeling very fragmented, doing all these different things at once. And although she was a very good teacher, all the various demands and projects, and her teacher said, oh, that's the lazy way. And she thought, she's like, well, what? You know, she's here, she's busting her ass, you know, and he's completely exhausted from doing all this stuff. And the teacher said, that's the lazy way. And so she's thought about it for a long time. What was that about? And after some months, she realized, actually, for her, it was the lazy way, because by being busy all the time, she never had to look deeply at herself. And so it was actually a kind of escape from herself. And that was the easy thing, that was the lazy thing, was to stay busy. So for her, it was to give up her laziness. Yes. In addressing why we tend to, at least for myself, I tend to not like a woman, and yet living in a template is totally fine. It has to do with associations organized religion. And, you know, my fear for organized religion, the moment you enter into it, all of a sudden, there's a lack of questioning. And that's my biggest problem with the whole, you know, once you start fitting into a structure like that. Good. That's a good fear. Yes. Lastly, you spoke about contentment being one of the prerequisites for, I guess, for further study. Classically, contentment and friendship are the precursor for the eightfold path. And now I've talked about discontentment, maybe one issue, renounce your discontentment. And I guess I have certain mixed feelings about that, because discontentment can be such a powerful motivation for positive action in the world. Not discontentment thrown with your self, but discontentment with the state of the way you are trying to address it. Well, this is a matter of words and definitions and all this, what we actually mean. But I think we start just ourselves. I mean, a lot of social activists have found that they haven't been much use when they're coming from acting themselves from a place of discontentment. They could, the world was, you know, something's wrong with the world had to be addressed. And so they went to address it. But, you know, they would get angry, they'd get upset. I mean, all these non-violent activists who then fight with each other. You know, if we start, at least it's possible to act in the world with the contentment, even with tremendous passion to take care of things. But at least you can be settled on yourself. That's possible. So it's a matter of personal content? I think so, yeah. We need to take care of the world, I think. It's very important. Yes? Yes. You spoke of monasticism as leaving home. And I think, in my own case, home was a place I really did not want to leave. My family was there. And yet I saw that being at home made me kind of crazy because I loved my mother and father, my sister, loved them. Still, their assumptions about the world, or their values, or beliefs about doing things, just kind of was driving me crazy. So, finally, I thought I would renounce home and leave home. And I think I want to join a Buddhist family for the values, not even beliefs, but the way of life of the Sangha because of that little bit of happiness that I had as the craziness of my future family could be replaced by joining the tradition of homelessness that these monks that we talked about, up here in Japan, I've started to continue to work. So I can see how, in my own case, this warming to renounce something might lead to a real marriage to the world or engagement with something more valuable or more satisfying. So, yeah, I think many people have found that, or someone once said that when you join a formerly Buddhist family, as a monk or a nun, or you enter a Buddhist community and live there, it's kind of like entering a family, and you're joining a family. And someone once said, hopefully that family is more functional than your original family. And there's been plenty of dysfunctional Buddhist families, too. But it's interesting, in the years that I spent the San Francisco Zen Center and some other Buddhist communities, there was a lot of alienated youths who joined who came for a while and were estranged from their family, estranged from their local neighborhoods and communities, and were maybe running away or maybe rebelling against it or just didn't get along with their family. It was very painful to go back and visit. And what was remarkable was that as people practiced over the years, that rather than being continuing to be home leavers, they actually learned a new kind of connectedness to the world, to the neighborhood, to their friends, to society, and to their family. And actually their Buddhist involvement, rather than being a leaving of home, actually allowed them to come back in in a healthier way. And then one more thing I'll say just my own life. When I was first living in San Francisco, before I was ordained, but living at the San Francisco Zen Center, living at Green Gulch in Tassajara, I was just kind of a beginning monk. I began seeing very clearly how my mind worked and all the psychological trips that I lived. And this thing about the food offering, that was minor compared to what I used to go on in there, right? Or it still goes on. But I started seeing all this stuff and I didn't want to be part of it anymore. I can renounce this. I'm not going to buy into my own trips. I'm going to find another way of living. But the sad thing was that I had a girlfriend back then. And I could see those similar kind of herch head trips, her egotistical trips or whatever. And I didn't have any patience for it because I was a whole new world of not living on all these trips that opened up to me. And I wasn't that I was, anyway, I wasn't cruel with her, but I simply wouldn't meet her at those needs that she had. And I looked back some years later and feeling regretful that I had some wisdom, but I hadn't learned the compassion for her situation. So that wisdom kept me kind of aloof from her situation, understanding it. And after I practiced more years, I had the compassion, but then she was long gone. Yes. I have a question about, I'm finding it hard to see a difference. As you were speaking, a fragment of one of the Cold Mountain poems came into mind. I carry this sort of knowledge to cut down senseless craving. And I've been thinking about how we see ourselves, I see myself crave something. And then there's that moment of, shall I do it? Shall I just sit, you know, shall I just watch myself crave? But that's not the same as renouncing, is it? Right. It's a different activity. And I wonder where the line is between just seeing craving for what it is and simply renouncing a thing. Yeah, that's a very good question. And I think each person has to decide, you understand the question? So the each person has to decide for themselves. Mindfulness itself is just noticing very clearly what's going on. If you can notice well enough, if you really bring a lot of careful observation, really honest observation of what's going on, if something needs to be let go of, it'll let go of itself. It's really beautiful, powerful, the way of mindfulness is extremely honest. You don't have to do the letting go. Rather, you can allow the situation to take care of itself and the appropriate thing will happen usually if you have enough time and enough observation. But we don't just live in a world of observation and time. We also live in a world we have to act and do things. And it's just, you know, if it's really obvious and easy to pull out a splinter, you know, if you wait long enough and watch long enough, the splint of body will kind of push the splinter out. But it's, you know, it's kind of silly, isn't it? Not just simply reach down and pull it out. So the same way this way is, you know, if it's easy to renounce or give up something and you can do it in a healthy way, which with understanding and honesty and clarity without aversion or hate towards anything, it's very valuable, very wise to use the sort of wisdom to say enough of this. I'm not enough, enough is enough. I'm not going to do this anymore or stop or stop this or renounce it. The danger with the language of renunciation or letting go is that people sometimes let go too easily or too quickly or too fast too easily and letting go either what's the things that are inappropriate let go of or letting go so quickly they don't understand the dynamics that cause those various situations to begin with. So if you're very good at letting go of your anger, for example, you know, Buddhism gets great letting go of anger and it comes up again and they let go of it. It's great and it comes up again and let go of it. But they don't have a clue what are the conditions that bring it, that out of which it arises to begin with. So if you let go too much and don't hang out with something for a while and get to know it, you might not be able to understand the roots of it. So it's your, you're the one who decides where the line is. That's two different things, isn't it? How so? Understanding the roots of it and letting go of it. Yes, two different things. I guess I was wondering if perhaps one is pre-emptive, whereas the other is ongoing. What do you mean? Well, if I say I renounce driving, I won't use an automobile. Yeah. That's preemptive. I will never use. I mean, as long as I am faithful to this balance of enunciation. Whereas if I just think about it each and every time, it's an ongoing process. I see. It's a different, perhaps that's a difference. Yes, so some things it's possible to just renounce and through that clear renunciation. Especially if you do it in a serious about, or you do a serious about with a friend or with a teacher or something. It can have a big impact in your life and it informs who you are and it's very hard to pick that up again. You renounce alcohol, you renounce gambling or you renounce, and you do it in enough ceremony, enough intention, and it's very hard to find yourself breaking that. But if you renounce lying, well, pretty soon you realize it's getting pretty subtle. What's lying, what's not. That vow to renounce lying, that situation becomes more the vow to look very carefully at one's speech and attempt to understand what is lying and what isn't, and to renounce it whenever it comes up. So there becomes an ongoing process. But sometimes, yeah, but sometimes you when you sometimes there isn't much of a route behind something and it's just the easiest to decide to let go of it. You're not really denying your opportunity to look at the route. It's just enough. I mean, sometimes in meditation, you know, you're sitting there and your mind just is thinking about the same silly thing over and over and over again, you know, and it's just, you know, you're thinking about pizzas, you know, and different flavors of pizza and new menus for pizzas and how you put pineapple on and, you know, whatever. You know, you're sitting there. Sometimes it's best just to say enough, you know, and just use a sort of wisdom and say stop. And that's, you don't have to sit there watching yourself make pizzas. Why? You might not know why, but maybe you don't want to know why. Francis. In that moment when you were observing, aren't you then renouncing the old reaction to the object? Yes. If the observation, the mindfulness is clear enough. In that moment, it's in the moment of mindfulness, clear mindfulness, there's no grasping. That's what the tradition says. And that's kind of what my experience has been. But you have to really bring that moment of clear mindfulness, discover where that is. And then if you can keep those moments of clear mindfulness up through time, something really remarkable can happen because you're letting go of the chain of clinging, which supports and creates much of our life. So yes. Bill. So actually, that giving up automobiles and giving up things and giving up things by looking at the root of them. Last November, for no particular reason that I could really state at the moment, I stopped driving the car to work. I started riding my bicycle to the train, and I think the train got stuck there, and then I went back to work, partly because of exercises and other things. One of the things that I immediately discovered was that driving to work made me crazy. When I got to work, I was relaxed, and I could deal with the day a whole lot better than if I had spent, took me longer to get to work. But by the time I got there, I was a lot relaxed. So now, I don't like, for some reason, I'm forced to drive my car to work like I'm sick, or I have an errand or something like that. It's very hard for me to do, I don't want to do it anymore, because I don't like to. So it's a healthy kind of healthy version of renunciation. You've realized that by renouncing the car, it benefits your life. What are some of the things that you all have renounced in your life that's been a healthy and useful thing to have done? Or what are some of the things you would like to renounce? Yes. I've got a question about that. The last three, the three-day retreat at the morning in the summer, at the end of that retreat, I came back, you know, and I had one cup of coffee. And I haven't had any coffee since, because over the course of that retreat, you know, I had the traditional retreat, caffeine headache. And I don't know why I stopped drinking coffee, and I don't know that it's particularly done anything for me, but I don't want to start again. It's just one of those things that I stopped doing for, and I can't, I can't sit here and articulate why I just did it. And it doesn't feel like a wrong thing or a right thing, but there is not, this, that's not the situation with a car where I renunciated the car, and then I discovered that it was a great thing that I did. This is just, I just quit. So that's an interesting distinction between renouncing, I think renunciation, to be renunciation has to be a choice, rather than just an evolution of what happens naturally. So let's hear, I'd like to hear, we have, here's a couple of minutes maybe, some of you can just say, what are some of the things that you've renounced, or what are some things you'd like to renounce? Yes. I think renunciation is a very heavy word, and I think that it's hard to put that word on to say that you sort of stop doing it sometimes. So I would have trouble saying that this was a renunciation. Okay. Yes. I think these were some wonderful examples of the way in which making vows is, for me at least, is always kind of productive. If I make a vow to do something, it becomes that much better. If I take a vow, then I'm going to ride my bike to work. The car becomes that much more fun to drive. In all cases where I've successfully renounced something, it's never been because I said, I want to renounce driving to work. It's always been as a ratification of something that evolved naturally, in which I just got sick and tired of changing oil in my car because I was driving it so much, or because I got sick and tired of something that was a consequence of doing something else. If I do those things mindfully enough and I understand those causes and effects, then I just gave up. I think that's pretty good. I talked about two different ways of renouncing, and one way was to renounce where it connects you to something that's important for you. So in Bill's situation, he renounced the car, if we want to use that word, because there was something greater, greater happiness that was obvious to him. So he was going towards a greater happiness. But if you use a renounce because you've heard it's a good idea to renounce, and you don't really understand the benefits of that renunciation, it maybe won't work so easily, but if you see for yourself the benefits and how really greater happiness for you, then maybe it's easier. I think the word renunciation is dangerous because Buddhism is hedonism. We're here for the maximum pleasure. Buddhism is? Buddhism is hedonism. You could. Maximum happiness. I'm maximum pleasure. The idea of giving up small pleasures that get in the way of a larger pleasure, giving up small happiness is giving the way of larger happiness. And so in that sense, we should just, I don't, I see that you give up those small things, these little steps along the way, but until you see where you're going, you don't make those steps. So what's the greatest happiness? I don't know how you got there. What do you think it is for you? For me, it's one of the things I'm very conscious of is that I see things that I want them, and there are a number of kinds of things that I want them to be. The greatest happiness that you know? When I'm doing something that I don't care. And you don't care? I'm just doing it and enjoying it. So, doing things without self-consciousness? I may even be conscious of myself, but I don't particularly care whether I'm conscious of myself. Doing things without concern. Thank you. So maybe one more, then we can go home. Yes, Margaret. Yeah, that reminded me. What I try to do sometimes when I shop is if I see something, you know, there's me, I want that. Sometimes I catch myself and say to myself, what do I really need that? And so it's kind of a momentary, I guess, renunciation of certain things. So there's this impulse to get this, this will make me happy. I settle back, no, I don't really need that. Sometimes realizing that the happiness we want from the things is not going to come from that anyway. Sometimes you get your own happiness, and you're going to get your own happiness. Sometimes you get it, and then two days later, let's go to the store again. Yes. I bet there's lots of people here, myself included, who have given up cigarettes. I mean, I'm amazed when people smoke now, because I think so many people, my generation anyway, it was very easy to give it up in a sense of understanding what the health detriments were. And as I was thinking about this, I gave it up, but I've also had the occasional cigarettes since I gave it up, which does that mean I gave it up or I didn't give it up? It's not the same sort of thing as it was. And I think many people. So you've given up the addiction, perhaps. But you haven't, you know, maybe that's the important thing is the addiction, not the thing itself. Maybe one more. I don't know either whether I can use the word renunciate or not, but I stopped doing a lucrative profession and a well-respected profession, and so gave up both the doing of it, the respect for it, the money that I got from it, and the identity, certain amount of identity that came from doing it. But if I may, maybe it's not appropriate to say this completely, but you'll forgive me, I'm sure. The full appreciation of that renunciation took a while to be able to learn, right? Yes, in the sense that, yes, I think that there were subtleties of it that I wasn't aware of. I wasn't aware of ways I was identified with it until I left it, so the appreciation for not being less and less identified with that. And same thing with the financial aspects of it, because I wasn't conscious of it, I became conscious of it. And I also gave up TV, so... So anyway, the word renunciation is somewhat a problematic term, and we can probably manage a spiritual life quite well without this word. And there are other ways of talking about the same thing, just a matter of the words we choose. But I think it's well worth thinking about a little bit. What could you renounce? So that you can be more content in your life. What stands in the way of your deep contentment, or what stands in the way of your happiness, or what stands in the way of your connection with life and other people? Is there something that you can let go of and give up in a simple way, so that you become more fully who you are? So you might think about it. Thank you all.
