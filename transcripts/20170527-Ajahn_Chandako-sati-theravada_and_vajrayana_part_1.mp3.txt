Om Many Padme Om. 
So Tenzin and I, we live up in the woods, we came down from the mountains this morning. 
One of the reasons we know each other is because we are neighbors, up in the mountains of the Santa Cruz living in the Redwoods. 
We also know each other from living in New Zealand together. 
Many years we were both there and saw each other regularly. 
So today we're going to talk about our respective traditions, talk about the similarities, talk about the differences, maybe give it a bit of a background, a bit of historical background depending on where people are at. 
We can give a less or more detail. 
How familiar are people with the forest tradition or the Vajrayana tradition, yeah, yeah, okay. 
So we'll kind of gauge how we approach things depending on where the audience is at. 
So we tend to teach extemporaneously, responding to the specific situation and people that are in the room. 
So the way that today came about, actually last year Achan and I were invited to teach a, I think it turned out to be like three and a half day, four day retreat together at Vajrapani Institute which is where I live in the Santa Cruz Mountains next door to Achan's Hermitage and our friend, our old friend Gil Franstahl invited us one day to lunch at his new, the guiding teacher of this center at his new retreat place in Scotts Valley just to tour us around and check it out and he heard that we were doing this four day retreat and I think on the basis of that he decided to invite us to come and asked Steve to organize that for us to come in one day and last year we had four days and didn't run out of things to say or do or talk about, it was very interesting. 
I found, I learned so much about the Thai forest tradition. 
I think I thought that there would be a lot more differences between our two traditions than it turned out that there were. 
One of my memories of that time was one of us would start talking about a topic. 
We decided, oh do you want to do a thing where like you have an hour and 15 minutes and then I have the next hour and 15 minutes or should we just sort of jam, you know, and kind of go back and forth and we're like, no, we've known each other for years, let's just, we can do this, just freestyle and so sometimes we'd have a topic and one of us would start talking about it and then turn to the other one to go, okay, what's your view and we'd go, yeah, pretty much, yeah, that's just like that. 
So I was, yeah, it was very interesting to me to find out how much more similarity than difference and I think that's one of the beauties of having an event like this because historically in Asia, this never would have happened, you know, historically Tibetan, culturally Tibetan nuns before 1959, I'm sure never would have had an opportunity to meet a practitioner of the Thai forest tradition and exchange views, you know, so that's one of the beauties I think of kind of Dharma as it's coming to these countries where we're able to meet each other, practice together, talk to each other, some of the views that were held historically about these great gaps between the different traditions, I'm finding just, you know, aren't as true as one would be led to believe from some of the historical texts and things. 
So that's kind of what we want to do today, just sort of a little synopsis. 
We also realize that people have questions that we would never predict. 
So we're not only going to have a chance for you to just raise your hand, but since sometimes people are shy, we've got a little fishbowl with pieces of paper in it. 
And I think during the break, maybe we'll put it next to the tissues just on that lead right there. 
And so during the breaks, if you're shy or if, you know, whatever reason you'd rather write down your question, we'll try and deal with those as well. 
Tenzin has one request. 
Please do not ask if we wear underwear. 
No, special underwear. 
Let's just get that out of the way. 
My trans mother knows about this. 
One time I was giving a talk and they said Mormons and Sikhs apparently have special underwear. 
So somebody raised her hand and said, do you wear special underwear? And I'm like, that's a really personal question, like where does that come from? And they're like, oh, no, you know, these other religious traditions. 
So yeah, just don't ask about our underwear. 
Anything else is fair game. 
Why do we shave our heads? That usually comes up. 
We can predict. 
But yes, sometimes we're talking on the car and the way here, you know, sometimes the whole idea of what is it like to be a Buddhist monk or nun living outside of Asia or even being a Buddhist monk or, you know, American Buddhist monk or nun living in Asia, you know, there's questions we wouldn't predict because it's our life. 
But sometimes people have things that they're curious about. 
So just throw it open to whatever it is you're curious about. 
Do you want to talk about history a little bit? Yeah, I went, last night, I'm living up in the forest in a tent and last night in the middle of the night, some animal jumped on me. 
A small one, not like a mountain lion. 
Yeah, I didn't realize it was small until after it jumped on me, but a dreaming and then suddenly it was like, and turns out a mouse was making a nest in my bag and then decided, for some reason decided to jump right on me in my sleeping bag in the middle of the night. 
And then before that, one of the people that I was staying with down there was starting up his car at midnight to try to keep warm, cold, which was fine. 
But unfortunately, that meant I had to get up and go around and see what was going on. 
So I'm a bit tired today, I'm going to sleep. 
Go easy on him, not any really difficult questions. 
So we thought we'd begin by just kind of talking a little bit about the historical context of the two traditions that we represent to just sort of set the context and some of this you all may know, there might be Buddhist historians in the room that know a whole lot more than we do, but like, why is it that there's these different traditions in Buddhism that kind of evolved with slightly different styles and so forth? We thought to just begin by setting the context a little bit. 
So just as a basic overview, you know, originally, of course, there were no schools of Buddhism. 
There was just the Buddha teaching initially small group of disciples which quickly grew and as far as we know from historical context, by the time he passed away after teaching for 45 years, then he had monastic communities of hundreds of thousands and then at least tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands of followers. 
So it was already well on its way to being a very large, very large tradition. 
You know, it had a lot of momentum going at the time the Buddha passed away, but at that time there were no, well, I mean even at the time you had Devadatta, which was the Buddha's cousin kind of trying to create a different bit of a schism, but there were no distinct schools yet, then gradually over periods of time certain emphasis became, certain styles of teaching became more emphasized, you know, in different groups. 
And even in the time of the Buddha you had that, some of the great disciples of the Buddha, for example, Sariputta, venerable Sariputta was known to be foremost in wisdom and so those people who were very inclined to approach the Dhamma from a sharp, refined intellect would kind of gravitate towards him, venerable Mahamogalana was foremost in psychic powers. 
So those people who had very deep samadhi and a more samatha approach would gravitate towards him and they would work together as a team to kind of bring groups of people to full enlightenment. 
And then you had other teachers such as Mahakazapa, who was foremost in ascetic practices. 
And so those who would gravitate towards practicing very intensely would kind of gravitate to him as their inspiring example. 
So even in the time of the Buddha you would have different emphasis, ways of approaching the Dhamma. 
And then gradually, you know, we're talking about over a period of hundreds of years and certain groups tended to form sometimes with geographical separation, sometimes they would all be living in the same monastery, but they would tend to have different emphasis. 
Approximately about 500 years after the Buddha passed away, a group which we now know as the Mahayana gradually came into their own. 
And some of, as that became more formalized, then that's where we start to see the first real distinctions both in the suttas. 
And even at that time, you would still get people living in the same monastery. 
Sometimes you would have Mahayana, Theravada, both in the same monastery in the same area. 
Because as long as they were following the Vinnaya, which is the monastic code, then everyone lived together quite comfortably. 
But increasingly, theoretically, differences began to become much more distinct. 
Terms began to be used differently, aspirations, ideals began to change a bit. 
And this then really became more solidified over periods of many hundreds of years. 
And especially when then Buddhism went to, for example, China. 
At the time the Chinese pilgrims were coming to India, the type of Buddhism that they brought back to China was Mahayana Buddhism. 
And then from that, that became very distinct, which then led to Japanese Zen Buddhism, etc. 
And then when Tibet went way down the line, about 700 AD, I think, is when the first practitioners from Tibet started to come down to India, or Indian teachers started to go to Tibet, then they were bringing Vajrayana Buddhism to Tibet. 
And this was a gradual progression, or just a difference in styles. 
So that's, as a general, very general historic overview, of course, it's much more detailed than that. 
So these days, we generally talk about the Theravada, which Theravada aspires to go back to the original teachings of the Buddha, what as far as we can determine out of the original teachings of the Buddha. 
And it takes that as the basis. 
Mahayana has an additional set of sutras. 
Typically in Theravada, we talk about Suta, S-U-T-T-A, as the Dhamma talks, the recordings of the Dhamma talks of the Buddha, in Mahayana tradition, more of the Sanskrit base, so they talk about sutras. 
So that's another way to kind of distinguish, if we're talking about sutras, then they'll be of the Mahayana tradition. 
Do you want to say a bit about just the historical development of the Mahayana and Vajrayana in India? And as Ajahn just said, you know, there's different terminology for these two kind of main branches, and then of course, in different countries, different traditions evolve. 
You'll sometimes hear this sort of old fashioned words, which aren't, you know, preferred really now of Hiniyana and Mahayana, and those are kind of bad words, because they literally mean like lesser and greater vehicles, so it's really quite disparaging. 
It doesn't, it doesn't, sorry to interrupt, but just to clarify, Mahayana means the greater vehicle, which is I think a polite, very nice term, polite, but sometimes in the older texts, the Buddhist texts, you find the term Hiniyana, so Hiniyana, the word Hina in Pali refers to, it means base, vulgar, it doesn't mean lesser. 
If a lesser would be chula, which would be okay, that would be fine. 
So it's even worse than less. 
No, it's, it's what you say. 
Yeah, no, it was, it was deviant, it's a term that was devised as a derogatory put down. 
So there never was a tradition or sect called the Hiniyana, you know, so we are the, we are the base vulgar ones. 
We are the lowest of the lowest. 
So that's a bad word, so don't say that word. 
That term was intended to be a derogatory put down as, because there was sectarian division. 
So that's why we don't use that term, terravada means the way of the elders. 
And then for a while, you know, there's, so there was different terminology that was sort of tried out as, as an alternative to this like bad word. 
For a while, people were using northern school and southern school, which was kind of okay, just because it sort of describes the geography, the terravada spread initially to Sri Lanka and then from Sri Lanka throughout like Thailand, Burma, parts of Vietnam, whereas the northern school, you know, kind of went to China, Korea, Japan, Tibet. 
Nowadays, and I really like this, and Anjan just alluded to it, his Holiness the Dalai Lama recently wrote a book called One Teacher, Many Traditions, I think is the name of it, something like that, where he's really goes into a lot of detail about just the, the distinctions between the two traditions. 
And he prefers the terminology, the Pali tradition and the Sanskrit tradition, because then that really goes back to, you know, the, the original text, the language of the original text. 
And it doesn't have all these connotations like some of the other language does. 
And even when you talk about northern and southern tradition, well, now we've got Australia, Europe and North America. 
So where does that fit in? And New Zealand, not to leave out, last but definitely not least, you know, so even to talk about northern and southern school used to be sort of historically accurate. 
So people have been trying with this language and lately, nowadays, I've adopted his Holiness the Dalai Lama, Sanskrit tradition, Pali tradition, because it really refers to kind of the root text that the tradition came from. 
So just a little bit more kind of detail about the Tibetan tradition. 
Somebody, the other day, somebody was giving a talk and they said incorrectly that the Tibetan tradition began in China, right? And maybe they're saying that because politically now, you know, Tibet was invaded by China. 
But actually in Tibet, the tradition came directly from India into Tibet. 
And it was during a period of time of the flourishing of these great monastic universities where Buddhism really got established in Tibet. 
So sometimes his Holiness the Dalai Lama talks about the Nalanda tradition and he refers to Tibetan Buddhism. 
There was a couple of huge monastic monasteries, several in and around the area of Bihar and kind of the central Ganges Valley. 
One was Nalanda Monastery, one was Vikramashila. 
Several other ones, Odantapuri was another one nearby in that area. 
In between the years of about 800 and about 1200, these monasteries were really flourishing. 
And as Ajahn said, monastics of all the different philosophical traditions live together, study together, debated. 
There was this incredible kind of flourishing of these commentarial tradition, you know, of study of the sutras and then scholars would write commentaries. 
So this was the kind of milieu that was transmitted then to Tibet during the flourishing of these monasteries. 
So it was this very rich philosophical tradition, a lot of these Indian commentaries we still study in the Tibetan tradition. 
Master Shantideva that lived around 700 wrote this classic text called the Bodhicharya Vittara, the guide to the Bodhisattva's way of life. 
That's one of the main texts that we study. 
Also, you know, a lot of these masters that lived in those great monasteries. 
And also around the same time, there were kind of the flourishing of what we call the Mahasiddhas or the great kind of yogic masters too. 
Many of whom had been great masters in the monasteries and then left the monastery in order to pursue a more yogic practice life, living out in the forest, begging for meals and so forth. 
And in fact, the biography of many of these masters, one of the masters in his biography, they say that he had a vision, you know, an old hag, a wise woman vision, you know, kind of came to him and said, as he was studying, and he was a great master philosopher. 
And she said, do you understand the words of the text or the meaning? And he said, oh, I understand the words. 
And then she started laughing and she was like so happy. 
This is the great master Naropa, the great Indian master. 
And then he thought, oh, that made her really happy. 
So I'll tell her I understand the meaning too, and I understand the meaning and she starts crying and she's like, no, you don't. 
It hasn't gone from the head to the heart at all. 
Go off and be a yogi in the forest, you know. 
So this is kind of both of these lineages were transmitted to Tibet, this philosophical lineage with all of these amazing commentaries and also this sort of yogic lineage that gave us the great master Milarepa, one of the most beloved masters in the Tibetan tradition. 
And I think the reason he's so beloved is his biography talks about all the struggles that he went through, you know, in his crisis of faith and the dark night of the soul and his suicidal thoughts. 
And, you know, we can read that and we go, yeah, that's more what it's like. 
Some of the biographies of these great masters are like, oh, then they met their master and then went off to the paradise of the Dakinis or something, and you're like, God, that's not happening for me at all. 
Like I'm just struggling with like my crazy mind. 
So we read the biography of somebody like Milarepa and then we feel a little reassured. 
Oh, he had doubts and crisis and fought with his teacher and left and then came back and oh, that's kind of more like my story. 
So anyway, just a little background of where that comes from. 
So sometimes you'll hear His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, refer to the Nalanda tradition and so that's kind of what he's referring to is this period of time that these great masters were, you know, writing commentaries on the texts and so forth, yeah. 
So in the last 2,600 years, there's been relatively little opportunity for the various traditions to interact from the initial time where it was thriving in India from approximately 500 BC to about 1200 or so AD, at which time it was wiped out. 
But by that time, it had been gradually developing and spreading, you know, peacefully, peacefully spreading all throughout Asia. 
And so depending on the period on which it went to a specific country, that was the style of Buddhism that was transmitted. 
For example, Sri Lanka was one of the earliest. 
So then for over 2,000 years now, Sri Lanka has been a Theravada country. 
And then later on, you know, China and Tibet. 
Now geographically, they were so distinct. 
I mean, these places were separated by rivers, mountain chains, I mean, great distances. 
And even though people would travel, there would be pilgrims traveling, there wasn't a lot of interaction. 
So it was very easy for the different traditions to feel like we've got the real thing and these other traditions are somehow getting it wrong. 
And this is partly human nature and partly due to, you know, everyone is very dedicated to their specific way of practice. 
And this is what the different traditions knew. 
And you still find that amongst the generation of our Asian teachers. 
This is part of what is unique about this period of history. 
I mean, it's completely unprecedented in 2,600 years that we have all of these Buddhist traditions living side by side, whether it lay practitioners or monastic practitioners, and it becomes untenable to hold on to these very fixed views of others unless people just continue to live in a bubble. 
And you do find that, you know, there are, you know, I think especially of our, you know, there's a generation of our Asian teachers who we hold with the highest regard. 
But it's, even if they come to the West, it's still difficult for them to fully appreciate or empathize with other traditions, whereas like Tenzin and I, I mean, we both grow up in the U. 
S. 
And We know the same rock songs. 
Still remember their lyrics, you know, 1975, you know. 
Which will be part of our jamming and riffing. 
We'll give a performance after the day off. 
We're going to do the Dhamma Slow Jam, maybe a bit later. 
So we have, you know, we come from the same culture. 
And yet we've ended up in different traditions, but it's very easy then for us to empathize in a way that even just one generation senior to us finds it much more difficult. 
You know. 
I mean, you get, you get senior Tibetan monks together with senior Thai monks. 
And of course, they're all smiles and polite with their translators. 
If it ever even happens. 
Yeah. 
Like it mostly doesn't even happen. 
Yeah. 
If it ever, even if it happens. 
But then privately, they'll tend to go back and they'll say, well, they're okay, but you know, we've got the real, it's too bad, it's too bad, they don't have the real Dhamma. 
Like in New Zealand, when I, I love, I traveled in Tibet and I love Tibetan culture and Tibetan teachers. 
But in New Zealand, I visited a monastery up in the north and, you know, paid respects to the Tibetan teachers there and, and he had his translator and, and he said, looked at me and said, Vajrayana, Mahayana, Hinayana. 
And so that part didn't need translating. 
I think I understand. 
And that was kind of the beginning of the conversations with her. 
Oh, where did we go from here? Okay. 
Thank you for, thank you for that empathy. 
So, so this is actually, I was going to mention last weekend, because after, last weekend, there was the, what, the opening ceremony, what did we call it? Blessing ceremony of Insight Santa Cruz, Betsy was there. 
And Bob Stahl, who we both know, who's the guiding teacher there now, invited both of us and a couple of other monastics and other, none from the Theravadan tradition. 
And then the local priests from the Santa Cruz Zen Center. 
And so we all did our respective blessings and then did a blessing together and on the way home in the car, Ajahn and I were talking about it and he, he said, you know, this is American Buddhism that we all do this thing together. 
He's like, it's already happening. 
You know, sometimes people say, well, what's Buddhism going to look like in America? It looks like this. 
Because he said that never would have happened and I was thinking to, yeah, totally never, you know, would that have happened for, as Ajahn says, just our own teachers wouldn't have actually done something like that, all together chanting together like that, having all the different traditions at the Insight Center, which kind of goes back to the Theravadan tradition. 
It was just this beautiful and then there were like five or six Insight teachers there with all of us monastics. 
So it was, it was just a beautiful example of like what it's starting to look like. 
And yeah. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
For decades, people of the, well, wherever Buddhism has gone historically, it will take on the flavor of the local culture. 
And so that's why you get such distinctions in ways of behavior or, you know, the difference between Zen Buddhism and Sri Lankan Buddhism is quite distinct. 
But then people say, well, what's American Buddhism going to look like? You know, as if we should try to create it. 
But the reality is it, this is it. 
I mean, we are creating it as we go. 
And it is already very different in the sense than any specific Asian country. 
This would probably never happen. 
Yeah. 
Absolutely. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
We can have some questions now that we've kind of gone through the history. 
Speaking of life, it's a ice cream cone. 
Okay. 
Is it, is it on? I can't, I mean, I can hear my own voice. 
I, is it on? Yeah. 
Okay. 
Thank you. 
That's such a wonderful overview. 
I, the last thing you said, I noticed some agitation arising in me around the comment about the Asian teachers and the sense of, well, they don't have the real Dharma or what the teacher said to you about your, you're on the bottom of the stack, buddy. 
Because I wonder as, as senior practitioners as you are, how do you, and this might be a really naive American question, but how do you reconcile? That just seems to me to conflict with the fundamental teachings, like whether it's universal bodhichitta or pure perception, or whether it's interdependent, like whatever the teaching is, the notion that, oh, this is a better way, that's a worse way. 
That sort of discriminating mind and that judgment doesn't seem to me to, I don't know, in some way accord with fundamental teachings. 
Yeah. 
So I, I just, I wonder how you as a practitioner come clear with that. 
And again, maybe that's just an American lens, but that, that's what popped up for me hearing that. 
Yeah. 
Partly it has to do with simply not being aware of other traditions and, and you can maintain a certain perception, whether it's self-perception or self-perception about the lifestyle and tradition that we lead is, is, and if we don't have contact with others, then that perception never really gets challenged. 
So I mean that in terravada countries, they think that they've got the real cookies, you know, because we go back to the original teachings where the real thing and everything that came after that is kind of a degeneration, whereas the Mahayanas feel like, oh, those terravans are still stuck in this, these old teachings where, you know, we've improved upon it and it's, it's much better now and, and those poor, lowly terravans, they can't really get it together and they're still stuck in their selfishness. 
And then the Vajrayana up in Tibet, you know, pre-modern times or could very easily maintain this feeling of, well, we are literally on top and, and even people who reach high stages of attainment on a personal level, they would never be, I mean, the whole idea of, of self-importance or oneself being greater or lesser than others completely disappears. 
Otherwise you're not enlightened. 
I mean, this is like basic definition of, of, of stages of enlightenment is you overcome that self conceit or even being able to compare oneself with another as being lesser, greater or even equal to, right? That all disappears. 
However, the texts themselves might be much more, a bit more rigid, right, or, you know, but in addition to enlightened masters, you know, the, the greater percentage of practitioners are people who maybe are scholars or people with lesser level of attainment. 
And so human nature is still very much prone to attachment and, and even attachment to the teachings. 
You know, we want to, if we're going to dedicate our lives to something, we, we want to dedicate our lives to the best. 
We want to feel like we're, we're dedicating ourselves to the best thing. 
And then from that we, there tends to be an attachment to those teachings and then there's something that's different. 
There tends to be the idea that, well, if it's, if it's different than what I believe to be the best, then it must be wrong or lesser. 
Yeah. 
And I, I just wanted to add too, because I, I know exactly what you're saying. 
And, you know, I, I think I've gone through periods of feeling sort of disillusioned sometimes with teachers because they sort of don't see things the way I think is the right way to see it or whatever. 
They're gone like, whoa, how could they have that attitude that's so narrow minded or this or that and the other. 
And for me, what I've had to realize is, you know, like Ajahn says, a lot of these masters are still very much a product of their culture. 
So they have, they might have incredible wisdom in terms of the Dharma, incredible compassion, like all of these great qualities and still, you know, our product of their culture and what they've learned, whether they've learned, you know, and it goes both ways too, because a lot of times the, the, you know, from Theravada, they say, oh, you guys aren't even Buddhists, like your Vajrayana isn't even Buddhism, like what are you, you just made this stuff up. 
So it kind of goes both ways. 
I mean, I'll give another example, which I've, you know, is, is kind of an example of, of something that, you know, we, we struggle with, with these masters. 
I have a friend and student who's transgender, and so he wrote a letter to our teacher, our Tibetan teacher, about his transition and was asking some question or something. 
And so our teacher, he doesn't know what being transgender is, like he's this old Tibetan Lama, like he has no idea, right? Like how would he know? Nobody's ever explained, like he doesn't read the newspaper, he doesn't know what's going on with the North Carolina bathroom bill. 
So he, you know, it's like off the radar completely. 
So he rides to my student and says, it's very traditional thing. 
If you want to be a man, pray hard to be reborn as a man next life. 
That's the way to become a man, which is just the standard line. 
And of course the student's super upset. 
So I had to just sort of deal with that and say, it's his culture. 
He doesn't get it. 
He sat down and explained to him. 
He doesn't understand the politics. 
He doesn't understand the social justice. 
You know, just say, yes, he's this incredible being that teaches Dharma so well and is it totally a product of his culture and just doesn't understand this one thing. 
So for me, it's helpful. 
I mean, it's hard to ask people to compartmentalize and it's hard for me to compartmentalize and sometimes I have to to realize, well, I'm a product of my culture too and all these social justice issues that are super important for me that are just way important. 
Other people don't care about it at all and I can't somehow make them wrong. 
I'm a product of my hippie revolutionary, you know, progressive culture with my values. 
So you know what I mean? So it's just a little bit compartmentalizing, but in a way that's just, I think, helpful and not disillusioning and then you just go, okay, this person doesn't understand about being transgender, but he, wow, he totally knows about compassion and I can learn so much about that. 
I just need to realize that because of his culture, there's other things he doesn't understand and I think this, you know, the kind of history and this just keeps falling off. 
Kind of the divisiveness around, you know, we're better than you, like Ajahn says, you know, part of it's just human nature and a big part of I think is ignorance that they've never sat down and have these conversations because like I said, I mean, even though Ajahn and I met each other like 10 years ago and we've been friends, but it was last year when we talked together that I learned so much more about his tradition, like we hang out but we don't sit there and go, what's your view of selflessness? Oh, wow, that's not so different than ours, even though my texts say there's like this huge gap, right? So it's just, it's just education and information, you know, really can help. 
Yeah. 
Okay, is it okay if we take some questions? Yeah, good. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
Yeah. 
Yeah, I have actually kind of a similar question because when you are giving your historical view, you used several times the word empathy and talking about a different tradition and I was wondering if you can give your definition of empathy because going into this question, like in my mind, and I'm kind of new to Buddhism just a few years, I feel that I'm actually learning about empathy and compassion for all beings and so like hearing that two traditions cannot empathize with one another, then it makes me feel like what is empathy? Empathy is the, or at least I would define it, is the attempt to try to see reality from another person's perspective or another tradition's perspective, which really goes against our grain as human nature, you know, we tend to, we have our perceptions, we project them out and this literally becomes our reality without thinking that other people are doing the same thing and they're perceiving and projecting possibly very different perceptions and neither of those perceptions in and of themselves are our ultimate reality, right, neither of those perceptions are better or worse than the other. 
They're both based on whatever information and causes or emotions or cultural conditioning that those people have and if we don't challenge our perceptions, then we just tend to think if I perceive it this way, that's reality and therefore it must be real, it's right, it's true, I can see it right here in front of my eyes and if someone says no, that's not the way it is, then they must be wrong, right, so empathy is making that effort to say well if they perceive it differently, if they're practicing differently, living differently, how about if I try to see it from their perspective? Now we can never do that 100% but making that effort to try to see something from another viewpoint, it makes a huge difference in getting along in harmony. 
So I guess that that's the definition that I was kind of thinking. 
I think it goes along her question is I guess I feel a little lost because first I've only studied in the inside meditation center here, like no else and I've learned to actually do this, what you're describing, empathizing with different people and so seeing you two which you seem to be great friends and totally empathetic towards one another but I'm here and you're talking about in general the context of those groups and I'm kind of puzzled. 
I think it's a process, you know when you were talking I was thinking of another example I've just started volunteering with this group in San Jose called the Islamic Networks Group and they've been in existence since like the mid 90s and what they do, their main thing is sending Muslim speakers out to schools, corporations, hospitals just to inform people about Islam, right? Even long before like this rampant Islamophobia and then about I think 12 years ago they started an Interfaith Speakers Bureau so I'm just training to be part of their Interfaith Speakers Bureau because sometimes the schools, in fact I went to a boys prep school in San Jose the other day to be part of this Interfaith panel and their main thing and it really struck me in their mission statement was they were saying kind of their main mission is they think that face to face encounters does more to break down stereotypes and misinformation than anything else, right? So that's what they do and that's what they're doing because it's so easy to hold these stereotypes when you've never met a Muslim or you've never met a high forest tradition, you know. 
So I think it's slowly, slowly the more we encounter each other, the more we have these dialogues, the more we have these conversations just like the Islamic Networks Group is trying to do in the Bay Area and around the U. 
S. 
just face to face encounters I think and that takes time like Buddhism in the United States is you know very recent I mean the first were some Japanese masters that came kind of early in the century and Zen sort of established first and now the other traditions are establishing so it's still new that we're actually having these face to face encounters with each other and it's already breaking down a lot of the stereotypes, a lot of the judgment, a lot of the misconceptions, so I think that's, I mean to me that's the answer, it's just a very personal answer of you know like meet a Muslim and speak to a Muslim and your view will change and your stereotype can't survive the encounter and I think it's the same thing for our traditions as well. 
Sometimes it depends on who you meet. 
I mean there are, there are Theravadans and Tibetan masters that if they did meet they would just reinforce each other's perceptions of each other you know and so that happens as well. 
Yeah so I would make me think when you said that face to face, do you think that there is a way to increase this empathy without the face to face meeting through actually the practice? That's a really, yeah that's a really good question, I mean we definitely can just theoretically right have that perspective taking and just try and go outside our own limited kind of narrow minded views. 
So yeah I think even theoretically, I mean I was just kind of thinking I think it just really automatically happens whether you're intending to do it or not through these face to face encounters but for sure if you're willing, I think it's the willingness is the biggest step and like Atran says it's a little bit human nature. 
My team's the best team and my team's better, I mean it's a little bit human nature and so even to be willing to challenge yourself in those views. 
And I think people, I mean I don't know, I'm not a psychologist, I think sometimes that kind of holding to your team being the best actually comes from insecurity and your own doubt that the path is right for you. 
I think the more secure you are that your path is the right one just for you personally, the more open you are to hearing other people's views. 
I think it's the more insecure we are, the more we have to say my team is the best team, I mean it's ignorance too but just psychologically whereas I find if you're just sure it's not saying my way is the best way for everybody but I'm really, I'm so comfortable in Tibetan Buddhism like for me it just suits me really well, it's my path, it's great and from there I can learn from so many different traditions and read very widely and get inspiration from so, because it doesn't threaten me at all, I think it's from that stance of feeling a little bit insecure about your tradition then the willingness to open to the other ones. 
I don't know, that's part of it too I think in just in terms of human nature. 
Any psychologist in the room might be able to correct me. 
If people are practicing correctly then the attachment to all the things that form our illusion of an ego will gradually dissolve and this is the thing which prevents us from empathizing so naturally we begin to become more sensitive to others, naturally we start to recognize the difficulties or the pain of other people whereas before we were much more just kind of blinded to that because we're so self-involved and as that begins to drop away a bit then we start to notice oh these other people around us too and maybe they're suffering too and maybe that's why they're in a bad mood is because they've just had something really difficult happen and then naturally empathy and compassion starts to grow and then from that, that tends to go out into other traditions. 
We should break maybe after this question yeah we'll take a break after this other question. 
Maybe soon if you were planning to address this during the day anyway please defer your answer until the right time. 
But here's my question I've been coming here for a long time and so I know how IMC teaches us to direct our mind during meditation so following the breath, knowing the characteristics of the breath, distractions come up, note them, let go, return the breath and so forth. 
But I don't know much or almost nothing about how in Vajrayana students talk to direct your mind during meditation. 
I've heard stories about visualizing deities and I don't really know anything so that's my question how do you teach people to direct your mind during meditation in Vajrayana? And I can answer that briefly now you know just to give kind of an overview and I think so in addition in the Tibetan tradition we do have focusing sometimes we call it focusing meditation where you focus on an object in order to develop your focus and concentration. 
The breath is an object that's used we also you know other objects can be used for that focus and in the Tibetan tradition one of the objects that's also suggested is a visualized image of a Buddha figure so for example Shakyamuni Buddha the historical Buddha you focus on the image in your mind's eyes so rather than the physical sensation of the breath to develop your focus you're actually trying to maintain focus on the image so that's one kind of visualization. 
So we've got focusing meditation another style of meditation in the Tibetan tradition sometimes we call analytical meditation or conceptual meditation and these are probably strictly speaking much more contemplation than meditation so for example to increase loving kindness and compassion there are certain practices that you do for example a metta meditation and the insight tradition would be one of these contemplations you imagine a person in front of you generate these thoughts of loving kindness maybe repeat some phrases in your mind over and over so in the Tibetan tradition we also have a wide range of those kind of meditations that are more conceptual not so much focusing on a specific object but kind of trying to generate a certain quality within you something like compassion or loving kindness or to generate an insight for example you can do a meditation on impermanence which also I think comes up in the four foundations of mindfulness as a way of generating an insight into the nature of reality being impermanent or changing moment by moment then in the more kind of Vajrayana style of practice we visualize these meditational deities and this is kind of a long story but just very briefly I always think of it in terms of like Jungian archetypes so we say okay is it an external being is it a quality within myself that I'm projecting as an image as a way of relating to it and it's sort of both so the energy of compassion manifests as Chin Rezi the bodhisattva of compassion and then we do some sort of a visualization where we imagine exchange of energy or the energy from that Buddha figure which is no different from our own enlightened energy so we don't see it as an external deity separate from our own potential for compassion sort of manifesting is this archetype because as we know that like the language of our subconscious is images right so we've got the level of gross mind conceptual thought words then there's a subtler level that works through images so I was thinking of it as this very skillful way of sort of catalyzing using those like the subconscious the subtler level of mind using an image because we always have some kind of exchange of energy with that figure it's not like oh that enlightened being is out there and I'm just this pathetic ordinary being here and all the enlightened energy like we always have light rays coming sometimes we recite a mantra so it's kind of a way of awakening that potential compassion energy for example within us so that's kind of debate I mean very quick and dirty it's a long story but just the essence of those Vajrayana practices where we actually do those visualizations that's what's behind it is you know kind of a what do they call it a light shadow like we project the shadow I mean in Jungian terms or we even project good qualities onto others but we couldn't see those in others unless we had that quality within ourselves so we're doing that deliberately with this image in order to tune into that quality within ourselves so that's the way I think of it again kind of a long story but that's the quick answer it's just what I wanted to hear great thank you oh good good thank you thank you all right so maybe so how about if we take a break yes we'll come back and do some Vajrayana practice no just kidding well yeah maybe when we get back we can address some of the the ways that terms are used that often creates an unnecessary level of confusion when using term using the same terms but actually defining it in different ways will understand and relate to confusion so hopefully we'll try to sort that out when we come back and we'll put the ball that's would you mind being my lovely assistant.
