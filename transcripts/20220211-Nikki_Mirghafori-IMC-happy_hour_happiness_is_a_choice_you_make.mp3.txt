The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
There. Recording on for audiodharma's sake. There. So hello, hello warm, hello, and
welcome everyone. It's good to be with you in this moment in time, whatever the
time zone might be for you. So I'd like to invite us to explore the theme, which is
actually the title of a book. And it's a theme that we have explored in different
ways. And yet it's so rich. So let me share the title. And the title of this
book is happiness is a choice you make. And I might have mentioned it before.
Happy or some time ago, happiness is a choice you make. And the subtitle of the
book I think is lessons from the oldest old. The title of the book is quite
provocative. Happiness is a choice is a choice you make. It's not something that
happens to you when circumstances are perfect, when you have perfect health,
when you have just the right amount of money or the right job or the right
relationship or the right house. All of these come and go. And yet, happiness
can be a fountain within a choice that we make that is not dependent on the
conditions. You can be sick, you can have limited mobility and still have a sense
of well-being, contentment, happiness. And these are lessons that we explore in
our spiritual practice. Of course, we do. And this book, which I do highly recommend,
is quite remarkable. So this journalist, I think New York Times journalist, I
believe. And John Leland, I think his name, maybe I should quickly find just so
that I'm referring to him correctly. So he spent a year with the oldest old
people, with seven people who were over 85, and they became his teachers,
basically, in that year. Yes, John Leland, L-E-L-A-N-D is his name. And it was a
time when his life had fallen apart after a long marriage. And he learned so
much and he shares that with humility in the book about how the people who
became his teachers had lost so much, had lost so much mobility and, you know,
with old age, what happens, and friends, relatives, with some of them not being
able to live where they wanted to live, being transferred, losing their friends,
etc. And actually, there is research that suggests that when we get older, even
though we lose so much, we lose so much, but the level of happiness actually
increases, which is quite surprising. But it's because of how people become wiser
in learning, in learning to be with, to appreciate what there is instead of
pining after the past or thinking about a future that's actually quite limited at
that point, because lifespan, we know it's short. So this art, this both
science, this art of turning inward, and there are beautiful examples in the book
how John Leland's teachers, these people over 80, 85, for example, when one
person is not able to go out to, you know, to have an outing, and then he decides
he's actually happy in his apartment turning on the TV and having ice cream,
which he's not, he's not supposed to have. But there's a sense of contentment
instead of thinking, oh, they didn't pick me up, they fell through, like there
was a sense of happiness or the sense of peace, their sense of peace with, with
the simple pleasures, with the simple joys, with the simple, actually, miracles
of life. So, so hence the title happiness is a choice you make, happiness is a
choice we make. And it's a training, we train ourselves with us, as the Buddha
invites us, we train ourselves, we train our attention, we train our attention
here, right now, right here, the mystery, the miracle of this moment, sort of the
past, the future, we have choice. Yes, of course, we can decide, oh, this is a
terrible moment, I wish I was in somewhere else, I had a different body,
different relationship, different, whatever. But, and yet wisdom is in
recognizing the beauty, the miracle, the grace, so many gifts in this moment
not to be taken for granted. So, I think I have said enough, so that is the frame,
that's the frame for the invitations tonight as I lead us in the practice of,
of metta and exploration. So, so I'd like to invite you to land in your body,
arrive in your practice body, you could be sitting upright, you could be lying
down, it's perfectly okay, see what this body needs in this moment, and landing
in this body. Hello, even if the body, there is discomfort and pain. Hello,
body, hello, this miracle of being, I'll share with you that my body is having
pain right now, not feeling well, and yet, wow, what a miracle I choose to turn
my attention, to open up to what is amazing, the breath, the sensations,
being aware of what is, set of what isn't, and I'll invite you to do the same with me.
Releasing, releasing any tightness or tension into the earth.
And also releasing, letting go of thoughts, of memories, of plans, of the
busyness of the mind. Not that there's anything wrong with thinking, but in this
moment, offering it up. Thank you, not now, please come back later. I'm giving my
heart, my full heart, attention, awareness to this practice in this moment.
Feeling the sit bones, contacting the cushion or the chair. Ah, the contact
points, releasing, releasing as if you're letting a ball internally drop, drop
internally. Ah, released onto the earth, in lieu of the chair, the cushion.
Dropped, dropped internally onto the earth.
Allowing awareness, awareness to, to receive the breath in the lower abdomen,
the in breath and the out breath. Soothing, comforting, slow, slow it down,
it helps to slow down the mind, to arrive more fully. Slowly and slowly out for a
few breaths, not for the entire practice, but just to encourage us to settle.
Slowly and the in breath, the abdomen slowly, more slowly out, the out breath.
Slowly and slowly out for a few breaths, the in breath, the out breath.
This breath is enough, can it be enough? Notice.
This is enough. This breath, right here.
Not just enough, but amazing, sweet, surprising, full of miracles, every breath
different, like a snowflake. Can we meet a snowflake of the breath with, with awe,
with appreciation, with contentment.
Can we meet a snowflake of the breath with, with appreciation, with contentment.
Can we meet a snowflake of the breath with, with appreciation, with contentment.
Here's an experiment to try out for size. After this period, you can go back to choosing
to be anywhere you want, but for now, what if, what if. For a moment here in this practice,
in this meditation session, we practice, we practice. Releasing, letting go of the thoughts
of the past, what has come into now, until now, preoccupations, and thoughts of the future.
I need to do this, do this, do that, I'm worried about this, what is going to happen to that.
This right now, let's, let's release, release, letting go of these helium balloons, let them
float. And what if, in this moment, just for trying it on as an experiment to see what
happens. Again, we can bring back all the thoughts later. But right now, experiment with a radical,
all perception, perspective, which all of us can. The perception, the perspective at
this moment is a contented, it's a contentful moment that you can feel contented, contentment
in this moment. If your mind goes butt, butt, butt, say thank you, just trying it out for
size, release, release the butts, let yourself taste. Let your body relax and soften as much
contentment as there is in this moment, just with a simple breath moving in and out.
It's a lullaby. The privilege of just sitting and being breathed, how awesome is that.
It's a lullaby.
The mind may want to turn to what's not right, what's unpleasant, what's hot, what's cold.
Can you tune into as if you're tuning a radio and there are lots of channels, there's so
much here, so much information, the deluge really, every moment, so much stimuli, the
body outside and inside. Tune the radio of your mind to what's wholesome, it's nourishing,
it's good. And the body and the mind, just to give it some support, let's bring in some
kindness, some loving kindness, some care, some warmth. For this being who is you, who struggles,
who tries their best, releasing into kindness as if you're held with kindness. It's okay,
no need to struggle as if you're an old person, practice as if you're a very old person.
Let it go. That's so much to do, to accomplish, but just to be here is enough.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And if judgments are arising, you're not doing this right, this is not enough, let it go,
this is enough, whatever is happening, whatever is here, whatever is here.
Tuning the radio of the mind to goodness, perhaps of some actions in the past, maybe kindness
or acts of generosity, let yourself sit in the ripples, nothing else to be done right
now, this is enough to sitting in ripples of goodness, trusting, tuning the radio of
the mind to goodness, you can do this.
Save yourself for us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Release, let go, it's enough.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
This is enough, release, let go.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You're doing your best, this is enough.
Thank you.
Release, relax, let go, the body.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
This here is enough, when we let go, pining after one thing, and thinking of what is not, going well, etc.
May all beings everywhere, including us, find the freedom, no peace, deep peace of contentment.
What is here, what is enough?
Thank you all, thank you for your practice.
I want to share a couple of reflections before I invite you to share yours.
One is that the sense of contentment, the sense of enoughness, this contentment, the sense of peace, that can arise, which might have arisen for you even just a little bit to taste it, this meditation.
I was tasting it, I didn't want to ring the bell, I was like, oh, this is enough, yes, the body is in pain, but this is great, this is plenty.
And that is not so much, when I was inviting you to tune into the radio of your mind to what is enough, it also means really, it's more about letting go, letting go of what is not.
And again, coming back to this book, Happiness is a Choice You Make, it's a releasing of the pining after, the wanting, the this to that, oh, this right here.
And again, not to say that this is the state that you may want to have every moment of your life, not suggesting that you give up every intention or desire, that's not the idea here.
But it's a training, it's a training that we take on, on the cushion.
And it comes to us in daily life, when there is a sense of our mind is turning to this, that finding fault with everything, like, oh wait, I know a different way to be.
So yes, we can continue to plan, to be in the world, to serve, to make plans, all of that.
Nothing wrong with thinking and planning in the world, but it can show us a different way of being.
So I've said enough, and I would love to hear your reflections, what came up for you, what did you notice, what worked, what didn't.
Sharing for the benefit of the Sangha, your insight, your aha moments, and also for the benefit of yourself to be held witness.
And if you've shared recently to pull back, if not, please pull forward.
And you can also type in chat, if you type to everyone, I'll read your name, if it's just to me privately, I will only read your reflection, not your name.
So take it away, what happened?
What did you notice?
Was there any peace?
Was this moment enough for anyone?
Did you notice the bliss of peace?
Or not?
Or maybe you're just too quiet to talk.
I see thumbs up, somebody's giving a thumbs up, yay, beautiful.
Whoever's giving a thumbs up, would you like to raise your hand and say something?
Oh, it went away, the thumbs up.
So that's great, that's our, here we go.
Aurora, please, there.
Hi.
I really appreciated the opening frame, and I felt like there was this like, my meditation was like, releasing, grasping, releasing, grasping.
And then when you said the bit about, you said something like, imagine that you're very, very old.
I got like, a long moment of like, oh, right, like, I don't have any other time, but this time, and it just like, it like, washed over me in this really helpful way.
And so I then kept coming back to that, like, remember, you're, you're, you could die tomorrow.
And, and it was really helpful.
Beautiful.
Thank you so much, Aurora, for, for saying, for sharing your insight and the practice.
Yes, this, this, this reflection of, I could die tomorrow.
I could die tomorrow, practicing as if you're really, really old.
What a great way to practice in the past, I've given the instruction to people to practice as if you're sick, as if you're ill, because when you're sick, you don't try so hard.
It's more useful.
And now I think I'm going to give the new instruction to people, practice as if you're, you're 90 years old, like, yeah, oh, wow, something happens in our bodies, right?
This in our minds.
Beautiful.
Thank you so much for sharing that couple of reflections in chat.
Bill says, pleased to see that slowing the breath did slow my mind.
Yay, Bill.
Wonderful.
At the same time, there was a slight physical strain in the breathing, in breathing so slowly.
Yeah, yeah.
So, so it's, there's lots of research about breathing and the effect of slow breath, especially slow out breath, how it calms the mind and the physiology.
There's plenty of physiological research and actually the book breath.
It's a lovely book.
I'm giving you lots of book recommendations tonight.
It's a great book.
So, and, and it's good to do that for a while, but then if it becomes strained, then let it go.
And my recommendation was just to bring that in at the beginning to kind of slow down and then to let it go, let it be normal.
And then Debra says, I'm still in the gooey, peaceful state and didn't want to use words now to shift out of it.
Yes.
Yes.
Thanks for sharing that Debra.
I appreciate it.
That's how I felt myself after the meditation is like, I don't really want to talk.
I don't want to ring the bell, but it times up.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And one more reflections when private, my practice is not regular yet.
And when I allow myself to relax to the deepest, I still feel this background rumbling of jangling nerves.
Like a quarter rattling on top of a washing machine on the spin style.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Thank you for sharing that.
And it's okay.
Spin cycle.
Right.
Spin cycle.
Right.
Oh, came the correction.
That is okay.
It's, it's, it's often like, you know, we're like running, you know, we're like a car that's driving at 100 miles per hour through our lives.
Again, going to get this done and that done.
And this slide.
I was like, and then we sit to meditate and the car is still like kind of moving shifting.
And, and, and I love your description of your jangling nerves, the quarter rallying on top of washing machine.
It's okay.
It's really okay.
Make space for that.
That's what needs to happen.
That's what needs to be present given everything that has come before.
And if you hate it, if you say, okay, I've sat down, I want everything to be quiet, stop you quarters.
But by pushing it away and hating it, actually you're given more energy.
So my recommendation is make space for the jangling nerves for the rallying quarters, like, oh yeah, it's like this.
And notice that how actually there could be peace, there could be contentment, even if there's rattling and jingling, the same way that there could be contentment, peace and ease with physical pain with things not being right.
The two can coexist and the moment you see that, there's a person who wrote whose practice is not regular yet, the moment you see that jangling and jangling can be together coexistent with peace and contentment.
The peace can be spacious enough to hold it, then wow, then your practice would open to the next level.
So dear ones, with that, I would like to invite us to share, to engage, to reflect.
Whoever shows up in the room tonight is the right person, is this person that you're supposed to be talking, listening to these special individuals.
They're supposed to teach you something tonight and you're supposed to teach them something, again, not preach, but you're meant to leave each other with a gift.
Let yourself be surprised and the gift may not reveal itself, so don't start like stressing out like, okay, I gotta say something smart.
No, no, no, just be yourself and your gift might just be silently holding present, just silently holding presence.
Maybe that's the gift that you give to the other person tonight, the gift of compassion, the gift of care.
So see what happens, see what happens.
I am going to create the rooms now and here we go, let me see, yes, I'm going to, so open up, so take care of yourselves, take care of each other, here we go.
Okay, the rooms are closed, everyone is back, welcome back.
We have just about a minute if any insights have arisen, especially from sharing and discussing in group and Sangha, especially if you're new, you're welcome if you wish, not to put anyone on the spot, but you can raise your hand if you want, or type in chat or not, it's all good, whatever makes you feel complete.
How was it to be in group tonight?
Oh, I see the heart showing up, oh sweet.
Neil, please.
I mean, you get the last word Neil, go for it.
So, I mean, this was just a lovely practice, right, and it just carried over into group, you know, I mean, it was just, you know, it just felt, you know, especially warm and supportive.
It was, it was very nice.
Thank you so much for sharing that, oh, it's beautiful how that mindset, that heart that carries over to the interaction, right, and it gives us hope, all of us hope that this is, this can carry to our other interactions in the world from the sandbox of the Sangha to other sandboxes.
So, thank you Neil for sharing that reflection. Yeah, beautiful. Thank you.
And Jerry says, contentment. Yes, yes, yeah, may you all be content. Thank you all. Thank you so much for your practice.
Thank you for cold fading for your own benefit and the benefit of others. May we all be free. May we all know deep and true contentment.
Thank you all.
And now I stop.
