Greetings again . For this week starting today on 
Monday, I will offer talks on refuge, saraṇa. In 
Buddhism, refuge is often associated with a strong 
religiou s movement in a person's heart. It's closely 
connected to the topic of faith, which not coincidentally, 
was the first week's topic at the beginning of “shelter in 
place ,” when we started these morning sittings and 
talks. And we're still in the middle of the  Coronavirus, 
but now we have a whole world , which is both in 
distress and in a state of transformation around racism.  
 
It seems appropriate to touch into this issue of the 
heart, refuge, as a topic for this week. So I'll go through 
the week in five talks , different aspects of refuge , and    
Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 2 - hopefully , it's supportive. I won't address these morning 
talks too explicitly to the tremendous suffering around 
racism that this country and the world is experiencing 
right now , but rather  the transformation that we're 
beginning to see.  
 
This Monday evening here at IMC , I will give a talk that 
addresses this topic explicitly. So for some of you who 
want to hear what I have to say on this,  it's California 
time at 7:30  for the sitting, and then a talk.  
 
Buddhists trace their practice, their religious life, 
mindfulness practice, and meditation, back to a man in 
ancient India named Gautama Buddha, who lived in the 
Bronze Age of ancient India. I like the idea that it was 
the Bronze Age  – just to make us understand that this 
was a very different time and place than we have  now. 
What arose in this rich culture  is remarkable. R ituals 
and civilization s which  arose in ancient India , and  which  
not only allowed the Buddha to emerge, but also all 
kinds of wonderful religious teachers around that time.  
 
The way the story is told, is that the Buddha had 
teachers who taught in meditation, different aspects of 
meditation, but he found that what they had to teach, 
didn't lead to the liberation that he  hoped for, the 
liberation from suffering. It somehow left suffering still 
there present for him. And so he went off to practice on    
Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 3 - his own. He did not have the support that many of us in 
the modern world have , or since then have had in 
practic ing.  
 
He di d not have refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma and 
the Sangha. He was Gotama; he was still not the 
Buddha before he was awakened. So there  was no 
Buddha to take refuge in. He had no community of 
practitioners and disciples and monastics that he could 
be inspi red by and take refuge in. And he hadn't 
discovered the Dharma yet. He hadn't discovered the 
teachings, the insights, the experiences  – that 
transformation that is at the heart of the Dharma. In a 
sense, he had to make himself his own refuge; he had 
to rel y on himself. And he actually said this very 
explicitly as he was dying, talking to his disciples who 
were there. He said, "I have made a refuge of myself. 
I've made myself my own refuge. And now I'll be 
leaving."  
 
This idea that he had made himself his o wn refuge  was 
in the word 'made.' He didn't say that he had found a 
refuge inside, as if there's some essential inner quality 
that we all have, which has been tapped into , and now 
he knew there was a refuge. But rather, he says he 
made  it. Elsewhere he tal ks about how people have 
their actions as their refuge.  
    
Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 4 - Both of these ideas . That the Dharma is not so much 
about discovering something  – that's certainly part of it. 
But at its foundation , it is something different. Acting in 
a different way. And by acting differently, living 
differently, we create our own refuge. So most 
foundationally , this means that we live in an ethical way.  
 
The way that ethics is described in Buddhism, the word, 
sīla, is not virtue as an inner quality. It really has to do 
with conduct  – that we behave actively in ways that 
avoid harming others in any way. It's an action of 
avoiding harm, and action of bringing benefit to the 
world.  
 
To do that is to make a refuge of oneself. To practice, to 
engage in the spiritual practices of  Buddhism is a kind 
of action  – even when , in certain meditation practices, 
the practices to not do, but just be, in a sense , don't 
have action. But in a way, not doing is a doing as well. 
And it's a choice we make. This idea of choosing how 
we are , and be ing in a way that's conducive, that allows 
for us to be a refuge is one of the movements of 
Buddhism.  So this means that the focus here is that we 
are the refuge.  
 
This idea that we are the refuge for ourselves was 
explicit in the days before the Buddha d ied, whe n he    
Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 5 - was giving his last teachings. He knew he was dying. 
He was a man of 80 , and he was sick.  
 
Shunryu Suzuki -roshi, the founder of San Francisco 
Zen Center  – when he was dying of pancreatic cancer 
in 1971  – said to his students, "A Zen master teaches 
best when they're dying." 1 Somehow, that's when 
everything gets maybe really focused on what's most 
important and most essential.  
 
So here the Buddha knew he was dying, at the end of 
his life. And he gave teac hings around refuge that 
resonate. I think they are still very important for today. 
He said, "Dwell, abide, with yourself as an island, with 
yourself as a refuge, with no other refuge." That's half 
the statement, but I just want to pause: dwell, live, 
abide, with yourself as an island, with yourself as a 
refuge, with no other refuge. It's a powerful statement of 
where a refuge is found. And this idea of an island in 
the Pāli  word, dīpa, also means light. And so some 
people will translate this  as, “B e a ligh t unto yourself, ” or 
“Be a light ; be your own light. ” But almost certainly the 
ancient meaning is 'island' in the way this word  used in 
other contexts.  
 
The metaphor of the island is that an island is a safe 
place from being swept away by the floods of th e world. 
 
1  The exact text of what Suzuki -roshi said was, “But things, you know, teach best when they’re dying.” Source: David 
Chadwick, Crooked Cucumber , p 377.     
Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 6 - In the  ancient language,  it’s a metaphor  for the floods  – 
floods of attachment, clinging, grasping, hate. There are 
all these powerful things that can take over, where 
people lose their wisdom, lose their best sense. They 
do terrible things to eac h other. And we see in the world 
right now lots of examples of people who have been 
swept away by floods of passion and hatred. So : to 
create an island for yourself, to create a refuge for 
yourself with no other refuge.  
 
And then in the second half of the  statement, the 
Buddha says, "Dwell, abide, live with the Dharma as an 
island, with the Dharma as a refuge, with no other 
refuge." So this idea of no other refuge. These two 
statements, which are said together, I think only make 
sense if we see that the Dh arma and oneself become 
the same thing. That there's no difference between the 
Dharma and yourself. To really discover yourself, to 
really be here with yourself , and to wake up to this life 
being that we are, is to wake up to the Dharma, is the 
Dharma.  
 
The Dharma is here. It's not something external. You 
don't go and get a lot of books from the library and read 
everything you can about the Dharma -- unless you 
read those books as a mirror for yourself. Unless you 
read those books and you're seeing yourse lf in it. Then 
you're seeing the Dharma.

This teacher, Shunryu Suzuki, the founder of San 
Francisco Zen Center said that when we bow to the 
Buddha, we're bowing to ourselves. So it's kind of here -
- to oneself. This is where we find the refuge.  
 
And then the Buddha goes on with the statement abo ut 
the island , and being a refuge to yourself. The Buddha 
then asks , "How are you a refuge to yourself?" And this, 
for me, is even more important. This is the how. Where 
do we find this, to live as a refuge to ourselves? Where 
do we find that in ourselves?  How do we act in a way, 
how do we be in a way that this becomes our refuge?  
 
The Buddha says, "How do you dwell with yourself as 
your refuge? With yourself as your refuge? Yourself as 
an island? With the Dharma as your island, the Dharma 
as your refuge, with no other refuge? Here one dwells, 
one lives, observing the body in the body, ardent, 
clearly comprehending, mindful, having removed 
covetousness and displeasure in regard to the world. 
One dwells observing feelings as feelings, mind in 
mind, dhamma in  dhamma  – ardent, clearly 
comprehending, mindful , having removed covetousness 
and displeasure in regard to the world."  
 
That's a powerful statement, I think. Our capacity for 
awareness, our capacity to be attentive, to clearly see    
Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 8 - what's happening moment by moment here in this 
subjective experience of our body  – this is how we 
discover refuge. This is how we're safe from the floods 
of the world.  
 
And the floods of the world are not really the floods out 
there. They’re  really the floods of greed, hatred an d 
delusion in here. In some ways , the refuges are both a 
protection from the outer world, but more profoundly, 
and very significantly – and this is part of the big koan  – 
the big question to discover for ourselves the answer, 
that the refuge is primarily a  refuge from ourselves, 
from tendencies we have inside that undermine us, that 
destroy us, that cause suffering and harm.  
 
And how is it that this inner refuge we discover from 
ourselves is also a refuge from being victimized by the 
world around us? What does that mean? Hopefully we'll 
look at as we go through this week.  
 
So two more things I'll say here. The Buddha said,  
I will teach you the refuge and the path leading to 
the refuge. And what is the refuge? The destruction 
of lust, passion, the destructi on of hatred, the 
destruction of delusion. This is called the refuge. 
And what is the path leading to the refuge? 
Mindfulness directed to the body. This is called the 
path leading to refuge.     
Transcribed  from https://otter.ai . Edits: MG - 9 -  
Again, refuge is important. It's found through this 
awareness, t hrough mindfulness, being settled  – finding 
the refuge here in one's own body. It's quite an amazing 
statement.  
 
So, this is the introductory talk , and I will continue these 
next days on discussing refuge and different aspects of 
it, and I hope that it becomes a mirror for you to 
understand and value something really important here 
in yourself.  
 
Thank you.
