The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood

You know we could have gone for a hike, it's a beautiful day or could have done
some shopping, I don't know, go work, or faced with the choices. But we chose to come here today.
And so some of you may have been coming here so often, every Wednesday, it feels
automatic, kind of built into the system. And yet there was a choice point and that
you came. And so learning to choose wisely can be a powerful skill to cultivate.
Choices, making choice, there's a form of a mental activity, it's kind of like a
bridge between a deeper part of ourselves, a deeper part of a deeper
emotional being, a deeper psychological being, a kind of deep kind of deep part
of us. It bridges from that deep part of ourselves with the surface levels of
activities, activities that we engage through body, mind, and heart. And through
a body speech and a mind. And so making wise choices has an impact in how we do
things, what we choose to do, and it will have effect on us. And so the choices
when we're touching in into where the choices are coming from, from deeper
parts of ourselves, we may be able to notice that sometimes the choices may
come from deeper kind of emotions, maybe the heart's longing, kind of heart's
longing for a released opening, or deeper understanding. And so it can come from,
for example, wise view and wise intention, and the deeper kind of
understanding we have about our lives, or how we choose to live our lives. And the
wise view, wise intention are aspects of the Noble Eightfold Path cultivation.
And so we can have a kind of understanding of the stress that's present maybe in
our lives, and how the stress is coming from, and the cause of stress that is
clinging, and the end of the stress, and the way that we can cultivate that leads
to the ending of the stress. And so there can be certain kind of a deeper
knowing from which the choices are made. You came because that is a deeper
understanding of the Four Noble Truth, and you trust that one can cultivate
through meditative for practices, mindfulness practices, where we come
on to a possibility to be free from the stress. And so those are some examples
of where the choices may be coming from. And so we chose because there is a deeper
kind of understanding, deeper intention. And we may also notice that sometimes our
choices may come from deep held emotions, maybe certain kind of fear that may be
operating, certain kind of a belief that, you know, I'm not good enough, and I need
to do something to make myself better. And then maybe this is one way that I'm
going to make myself better. Or that may be a kind of emotion that you want to
get away. Maybe there are strongly held emotions that you're not comfortable
with. And you end up choosing to come here as a way to run away from some
situations that you're meeting. That we may not even be conscious of that
sometimes in this kind of a choice that we're making. But you probably be on
know this or probably have experienced this when we're not very
conscious of where the choices are coming from. When we come here, the same
activity of coming here to meditate may have completely different effect. If you
came here, you made the choice to come here and then you did come. But it
was out of the sense of escaping from something that you didn't feel like you
wanted to be with. Then when we sit down very quickly, you discover that you'll
be having conversations in your own head with yourself about how you might
escape and you know planning the additional activities that you may need
to do. Because we can't quite escape our own mind. The alternative is that when we
kind of pause before making the choices and touch into where the choices are
coming from, we began to have a chance to reorient such that the choices that we
make are wise, wholesome, and skillful. So for example, you did come because you
were there were some unpleasant situation you were meeting. And when you are
touching in and noticing that that was the case, that was something
bubbling inside. You now have a point in time where you can choose what might be
wholesome. And the choices might be that, oh, you know, I know there is a way that I
can cultivate some kind of a grounding in myself, in meeting that is unpleasant.
And coming here, the same activity you're coming here, to cultivate that capacity
to be grounded in the midst of unpleasant. Now that becomes something that is
supportive of our overall sense of a well-being and long term kind of a
well-being, instead of kind of the sense of running away, but our mind can still
be caught in it. And so it's the same activity, but it can be coming from
wisdom and compassion rather than coming from a reactivity or kind of a habit
pattern of our mind. And so this making wise choices and making wholesome,
skillful choices invites us to kind of a pause and a feel sense into the source of
what the choice is coming from. And I also wanted to say that this way of the
sensing and feeling into where the choice is coming from doesn't have to be
something abstract. In fact, the invitation is to feel and sense into the
deeper aspects of our being rather than kind of trying to dig, you know, trying
to figure something out. And in our meditative practice earlier in this
morning, I invited us to choose to align with something that is wholesome and
skillful. And the invitation was to see if you can feel the kind of alignment
through the body and through kind of in an embodied way. And so in some way, the
choices can come from this embodied felt sense, a deeper part of ourselves.
Instead of our self-centered mind that can come with agendas, you know, I want
you should align this way, you know, you should do this and that. And so when we
can tune into this natural arising of the choices, we allow the choices to
emerge from wholesome, wise aspects of our being. And then the downstream
activities become something more natural rather than inserted by our ego-centric
agendas. And this kind of skills can be cultivated. It may not happen immediately,
initially, when we kind of engage in this way. We may be learning about how the
choices arise in us. And that's totally okay. Just like the cultivation is a
gradual training. And so we can sometimes when we tune inside and kind of look to
see where the choices are coming from, it's not always so clear. It's not
obvious. Then it's totally okay to make certain choices when you have to make a
choice. And then keep observing the effect. What comes out when you're
engaging in doing things based on the choices you made. And then over time, we
began to learn this process of making choices. And so in this way, it's related
to the cultivation of mindfulness, samadhi, and the cultivation of a wise
effort, kind of to be able to discern over time what may be wise and skillful,
what may be not. And so we don't have to beat ourselves up kind of, you know, when
we can't quite know immediately what may be present for us in terms of the
choices we make. And the last thing I want to say is, yeah, the last thing I
want to say is that over time, when there's a capacity to choose wisely,
skillfully, began to become available to us, and there can be a certain kind of
empowerment in our being. We can trust the choices that we make. We can trust
how we live from the choices we make. Because these choices, over time, we can
see that the choices that we make are aligned with our deeper kind of a value,
our deeper kind of aspiration. And so there is a totality of a being that is
more aligned with a deeper aspect of ourselves. And so in this way, we know
we can choose to live our lives in the way that brings a deeper sense of a
well-being in ourselves and for others. And so those are the reflections I have
for today, which is about choosing wisely. And so may we all be able to do that.
So thank you so much, everyone.
