 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay, great. So I would like to speak now about the structure of the polycan. Now let's take a look at this body of text and consider the different pieces of it. But to start, I want to begin by reading a passage from a frequently studied sutta. And I would like to suggest that you listen to what I read in a certain way, just as a little experiment. Try listening with your whole heart and mind as if it's something important for your well-being and worth remembering. Not in a tense way, but just being very present, as if the words are being spoken freshly in this very moment. This is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the disappearance of pain and grief, for the attainment of the true way, for the realization of nibbāna, namely the four foundations of mindfulness. Now where does that come from? So some of you may recognize it as words that are near the beginning of the satipatāna sutta, which is the most detailed instructions we have on how to establish mindfulness. And how was it to listen to that freshly, really taking it in? So the Pali Canon is a treasure trove of wisdom teachings that come to us in a form like what I just read. And we'll talk a little bit more about the history and the transmission later. My aim right now is just to orient us to the structure, you know, what is this body of teachings? So the Pali Canon is a collection of sacred literature that was originally composed as oral texts. And then over time they were preserved in this way and then written down in Pali, which is an ancient Indian language. And the texts record teachings that are attributed to the Buddha and to some of his disciples, and they include spoken discourses or sermons, if you will, stories, poems, analyses, and also rules for monastic living. So there's a lot in there. And just so that we see it kind of all at once, I want to show a diagram of the tepidica. So let me get that up. See. And Kim, you just used the word tepidica and I just thought I did. Okay. Sorry about the coloring on there. So the word tepidica at the top here means three baskets. And so this is a diagram showing the different three baskets, and I just want to talk through it, and you don't need to memorize this and you were sent it in advance so this is just to orient because sometimes there's a lot of funny words on here so I just want to point out what what they are. So we have three baskets here at the top, and one is the vinnia, which means the rules of monastic living. And it has these five books not obvious that there are five there but there are the suit to pick a, which is the collections of the discourses and this is I'll talk more and more detail about this in a moment because this is where likely where you've heard quotes from Dharma talks and other things coming in. And then we have the Abhidhamma Pitika, which has seven books, and this, these are added somewhat later, but there are part of the poly cannon. This is a kind of a detailed analysis of Buddhist psychology if you will. We don't talk about it a lot here in the kind of Western tradition but that doesn't mean it's not talked about a lot it's actually quite foundational in, for example, the Burmese Therapada tradition. So still very much alive. So I want to focus in now on the suit of etiquette, you'll see here that there are five main collections and you may have heard some of these terms. The D.D. Nikaya that's one of them Majima Samyutta Angotara and then this kudaka Nikaya, the word Nikaya by the way I think just means collection of the texts. And the kudaka is the kind of a bunch of smaller texts, even though when you add them all up they're bigger than any of the other ones, but in here you may have heard of some of them also here's the Dhammapada, for example. Some of you have heard of the Sutta Nipata. There's several new versions of it published recently, and the Tara Gata and the Teri Gata, the awakening poems of the monks and nuns. So, you know, some of these terms may be familiar if none of them are, don't worry. That's why we're talking about it but this is essentially it, you know, these are the teachings that have come down and we'll talk about, you know, how they were preserved and the degree to which they may have changed over time or, you know, are there other versions of them and so forth. But let's just take a look at each of the, let me stop sharing now. At each of the main collections because I want to talk through in the Sutta part that middle basket, what each of these collections of discourses likely is about, you know, why were they collected into these particular sets. You know what, what was put into each of these books why were they decided to be that way. So let's start and I have them here just because I like showing them. So we'll start with the Digha Nikaya this is considered the first text of the Ammanu Mysutas. And this is likely Digha means long. And so the long discourses of the Buddha. This is published by Wisdom, Bhikkhu Bodhi's translation. It's actually Maurice Walsh's translation, if you did, Bodhi did most of the other ones. And long probably refers to the length of the discourses. They're pretty long, some are short, but they're mostly quite long. And they tend to be related to positioning the Buddha's teachings relative to other teachings happening at the time. You know, the Buddha didn't live in a vacuum. He was there amidst other spiritual teachers offering their version of how you should practice and their ideas about philosophy. And so the texts in the Digha Nikaya tend to be, shall we say, defenses, philosophical defenses and ideas about why the Buddha's teachings make more sense than some of these other ones. So that's likely the purpose is to position it relative to others. The second text in the Sutta Pidaka of the discourses is the Majjhima Nikaya. This is the Digha Bodhi's translation from the book. The Majjhima means middle length, middle. So this is probably middle length discourses. There are 152 suttas in here. They're of middling length. But the purpose, you know, why were they collected? Why those ones? It wasn't really just for the length. Likely, this is a manual for new monastics. So this collection includes the major areas of the Buddha Dharma, including karma, faith, the path, ethical conduct, effort, concentration, mindfulness, living the holy life and awakening. The things that the major topics you would need to learn and study as a person who is already a devotee of the Buddha, whereas the long discourses were spoken more generally, maybe people weren't followers of the Buddha. So that's likely the purpose of the Majjhima Nikaya. And then the third among the Sutta Pidaka is this one, the Samyutta Nikaya. Samyutta means collection or this is called the connected discourses of the Buddha on Sutta Central, which we'll talk about later. It's called the linked discourses of the Buddha. So there are a number of different ways of translating the word Samyutta. And this seems this is organized by topic. So it has a bunch of stuff about dependent arising. It has a whole section on feeling tone. It has a whole section on the seven factors of awakening and the five faculties and the path and topics organized by topic. And so this was considered to be a text that would be used by serious meditators, maybe more advanced monastics who were aiming for awakening. And they just needed the sort of pit instructions about here's the detail of what this topic is about. I should say also that there's usually less context given in this one. It's just the teachings. Whereas in the previous one, I talked about the Majjhima Nikaya for new monastics, very stories. So it's very relatable and it's very human about people and their interactions with the Buddha. And you can imagine people kind of orienting themselves toward the holy life through reading these stories which have a context to them. OK, then the fourth of the major collections is the Angujara Nikaya. Angujara means something like advancing by one. And these are also called the numerical discourses of the Buddha, the fourth major collection. And these are organized by number. So it has the chapter of the ones and it has teachings that feature one thing. And then it has the chapter of the twos and the chapter of the threes up to the chapter of the 11s. So it's pretty interesting that would be organized that way. I guess, yeah, so the term means what incrementing by one or further factored. So these were probably, you know, maybe for teachers to be able to give a Dharma talk about, you know, be easy to grab one of these lists. But it also includes some of the less common teachings and it includes quite a large fraction of teachings for laypeople in the Angujara. So you're looking for one specifically about that. There's more of them, a greater fraction of them in that text. So and then there are the minor discourses. I won't have time to go through all of those, but, you know, maybe you've heard of the Dhammapada. This is Gilfronstol's translation. You know, as I'm holding this up, I'm remembering that Diana gave me this. So thank you, Diana, a long time ago. So there are many, many versions of the Dhammapada, by the way, many, many, many. That's something we might be looking at later. So, okay, so that's kind of a grand really quick tour, let's say, of these texts. And I want to just say now that if you are just starting out, you know, what should one start with? Well, we may answer that question in many different ways throughout this class, but the Dhammapada is a good place to start. A lot of people begin with that one. And if you're going to have any of the big texts first, I would recommend the Majjhmanikaya. It's quite relatable, includes all the basic topics in story form. The teachings are clear. It also has many of the main instruction texts about developing mindfulness and mindfulness of the body, mindfulness of breathing, so forth. Okay. So remember that at the beginning, I read a passage. You can at least remember that I read it, even if the exact passage has faded. But I want to just say a little bit more about that. Remember that, so does anybody know which discourse that comes from, the Satipatthana Sutta? Which one of those texts is that in? Yeah. Somebody wrote Samyutta Nikaya. Fred, you're unmuted. Did you want to offer? Yeah, M N 10. Yes, M N 10. So that's correct. It's actually in the Majjhmanikaya. It is the 10th Sutta, M N 10, Satipatthana Sutta. So remember, I'll read it again. This is the direct path for the purification of beings, for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the disappearance of pain and grief, for the attainment of the true way, for the realization of nirvana, namely the four foundations of mindfulness. So you see, this is remember from the manual for new monastics, you see that it provides a compelling motivation by referring to Dukha that we can all relate to. Who doesn't think about the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, the disappearance of pain and grief. This is how people come to practice. They have these, this sense of Dukha. And so it evokes that. And then it talks about, you know, here's the here's the way to get out of that. The four foundations of mindfulness. The rest of the text is then the basic instructions on developing mindfulness. So this is a very clear. And of course, it mentions nirvana as the goal. So this is the point of what we're aiming toward. So we have it also says at the end of the suta that if you develop this, you will attain at least the second highest stage of awakening, if not full awakening. So we can understand that this would be appropriate for the text, the collection that it's in. It's really quite it's for somebody who is already connected to the teachings of the Buddha and is ready to practice them. So I'll just end my last thing will be to say that how we relate to these teachings is really up to us. No, it's we can find ways for them to resonate with our own path. And we'll be talking more about that both today and on the 31st. But it's really up to us to find our own relationship. And we can remember that these teachings were originally living breathing teachings that were offered orally from person to person transferred from heart to heart. And in my experience, the same flavor can come through in the written texts, if we allow it to. So, thank you. Now we have a chance for any questions or comments that have come up. So please feel free to raise your zoom hand or see Alex raising his physical hand and you know it being run this. Go ahead. Yes, Alex, we can hear you. Okay, I kind of. I kind of, I'm kind of guessing that with a little anxious my talk in front of a lot of people so I apologize, but like the idea that like the way these sutras are written like they're written in a way that I guess, maybe was used as a form of memorization so I wonder how the Buddha actually spoke, you know, as opposed to like what we hear or like read. I'm sure he did. It's a very formalized kind of like, I don't know, kind of just a thought that crossed my mind. Yeah, it's a great question I know that we haven't heard it from some of the teachers at this point I wonder if Diana, or David, who haven't spoken much wanted to respond to this how the Buddha spoke about this. Okay. Maybe I'll just say a short bit here and I'll say a little bit more in a moment. How can we know. Like really how can we know, we only know what's been preserved over these thousands of years. So, this is something that scholars love to talk about examine that would actually speak poly or did he speak like a particular dialect that then kind of morphed into poly and the way these things are preserved but I think this is a, an interesting question Alex, and then maybe I'll just turn it around and say, how important is it for us personally as individuals to know precisely what the Buddha said. And, you know, I would add to that, another way to take your question Alex, which I appreciate, and I appreciate your courage and sharing it. I don't like talking in front of 77 people either particularly makes me a little nervous. Because another way to just take your question is how, how did he speak in the sense of to what end, and I think this week, you know, I think maybe we have a better sense of that, that he's spoken a way that was onward leading that would help other people like ourselves thousands of years later, come to share the insights that he experienced. So, that way of understanding how, you know, we're a little, I think we feel a little bit firmer ground. And we'll explore that as we, as we continue. Thank you, David, and Diana, and I see a hand up from Catherine. Hello. Yes, my question has to do with the questions that we've already heard in my group, you know, we shared the same questions I don't think it's a, it's really surprising, but it made me think of a question about the same type of subject, I often wondered, after having attended many retreats and teachings and listening also to to to Gil and other teachers, I often wondered how, how did, how do you go from the text, the Pali text to teaching to actually teaching, you know, how do you how do teachers go from reading the text in its, in its original form to teaching a class, or, or, or, or actually expressing these, these texts and I was wondering if, if, if we would get an idea of that during the course. Great question. How does a text become something lives in us, and maybe gets expressed through how we are. Yeah, so we'll definitely talk more about that in this course if it's great question I think that Kim used this short text at the beginning of the Satipatana, it's this short piece of a text and maybe we can hear it receive it in many different ways in different settings. And so allow ourselves to open to maybe different ways to relate to even just this little piece of a text. Great question. And I see I'll just maybe I'll just add that a lot of the expression of these teachings is a result of meditation practice. And so, these are often expressions of what people have found on retreat or through years of practice. So, Nicholas. I'm curious about commentaries, because I think, like for me for example with the four foundations of mindfulness there are some really incredible modern like Joseph Goldstein has a really incredible book, because an audio has a number of really incredible books that I really like deep into my relationship to that city in a way that would have been very challenging if I were just alone with M.N. 10 staring at it, you know, day in and day out. It's, you know, the curiosity for me is there's like this vast sea of commentaries of people who aren't alive now who've, you know, commented on, for example, this suta over millennia. And that's a place where, you know, I mean there's like intellectual fascination of what they said but in terms of really like enriching practice I think that's a place where I'm not really sure how to engage everything between things I can order on Amazon right now that everybody's reviewed, and the original suta. Yeah. Yeah, I would say a commentary feels like another ocean several few. Yeah, and sometimes I feel like a lot of modern teachers, also, really we're making our own commentaries of the teachings as well through how we experience them how we understand them. And finding ways to navigate this yet another big ocean. Maybe it's something that you know I like to register that interest and maybe it's something that in the future we can explore more. And I do understand some people are really interested in this, and some branches of Theravada schools really use this to in their own practice in some deep way. So, maybe I just take the liberty to receive this as an inquiry, maybe sometime in the future, we can explore that together. So we have time maybe for the last two questions. And we'll have more time later. So, Austin, and is the next one. Hi. I was just curious when I didn't get the name sample when you mentioned the one of the three baskets were mentioned. There was mentioned of like five books that are kind of almost like comparative text between Buddha, Buddhist Buddhism and other religions. And I'm just wondering, I was under the impression that overall, the Buddha was kind of against most or not against but tried to avoid. There could be many types of like metaphysical or epistemological speculation so I'm curious now to learn how that fit into the overall text because I haven't read about that. It's a great question I wonder if any of you can the teachers and Diana like to say. Well I think just I'll start by clarifying that you're probably referring I think to the D. D. Nikaya the first of the text in the Suta Pidaka as the one that where I talked about it being a document that positions the Buddhist teachings relative to other ones. And there you will find it's consistent with what you said in that many much of what he does in that text in my reading of it is criticize other schools as being too philosophical as not grounded in experience as being lost in concepts. So I think it's consistent with what you said but I also want to defer to Diana who's done quite a lot of study of this collection. I don't have anything more to add here, I would say. So maybe the last question from Kevin. Thank you. Just a follow up to the earlier comment about, you know, going deep with the Saudi patana and commentaries and so forth and something that I would really be curious to hear about from all of you who are so steeped in in practicing this material or any one of you who are interested in practicing this material at some point is, you know, what about what I see with some of the monastics that I've been exposed to I'm thinking about an alio and ajang suchito for example where the encouragement and the modeling that I'm seeing is going to be in the text like the Saudi patana suchita memorizing it in their case memorizing it in the original language and an allio's case, singing it to call it calling it to mind I mean, so that that and doing that with really all of the key sutas that are useful and practice so that they're available in the mind stream. And, and I just would like to know like, what does a lay person's version of that kind of practice look like thinking that all four of you must be expert and and realizing that going deep with selected things seems to be what I'm drawn to at this moment. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Deep bow is Kevin, and we will definitely talk about how we work with this test that deepens our relationship with it and how we practice with it. So, why don't we take if I can carry forward in a very brief break three minutes stretch get a drink of water, don't go off and get too involved in other things. And we'll come back and we'll follow on this exact question that Kevin has ranged raised by doing a little meditation, and incorporates the language of these of the text from the canon. So see you in a few. See you in three.
