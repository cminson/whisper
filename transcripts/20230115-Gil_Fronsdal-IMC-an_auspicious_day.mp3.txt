 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. So, okay. So today I would like to focus a talk around a particular poem that the Buddha taught. It was a poem that he seemed to have been eager to have his students people memorize because there's accounts in the ancient texts of, you know, him helping people memorize the texts. He had recited so they'd learn it. And it wasn't an oral tradition back then in the ancient world, so there was no library you could go to. So if you wanted to have access to teachings in the texts, you had to memorize them. And so all the sutas, all these courses were eventually memorized, but many of them were put to memory after he died. But during his lifetime, there's only a particular one that we have record of that he was actively teaching people to memorize. So I take that to mean that it was really important for the Buddha. And he gave, then he explained or gave an analysis of the poem as well. And whether the poem is a poem or whether it's a song is a little bit of a, you know, interpretive exercise. There was a time when some of the early Western scholars, especially from Sri Lanka, who spoke English, would call these kinds of poems ballads. And sometimes the way they're chanted can sound very much like something that we may be associated more with a song or a ballet or something. And that helps the memorization of it. And so this one is called, it has an interesting title. I call it an auspicious day. And the word for auspicious, bada, means something like something that is so fortunate, something that's wondrous, a blessing, auspicious. And but the word rata, R-A-T-T-A, can mean night. And but it seems in the ancient world, it also meant the day, just like in English. Day time, the word day means both daytime and the whole 24 hours. But in a week, so they would count the days by how many nights it's been. And so if you said, you know, an auspicious night, people understood in the context, it would be a day. So I translate it as an auspicious day. And it's interesting because the word rata is a particular grammatical formulation of the word raga, which can mean kind of a passionate attachment. And so one translation that Bhikkhobodi had in his early translation was an auspicious attachment. And so it's a kind of word play going on here. So is it OK to be attached? Well, if you're attached to this, maybe it isn't too bad. Maybe it helps you to be if you're attached to healthy things, then as long as it's helping you, it's OK to be attached. But when you realize it's hindering you, that's when we let go of it. And this is a very nice way of understanding attachments. There's a tendency in Buddhism to kind of like it's all or nothing. Like if you're attached, let go. You're not supposed to be that way. But rather that recognize, well, there's often a reason to be attached. It's a reason why people are attached. It's a strategy for something. And maybe sometimes it's not a bad strategy. And so, for example, being attached to your health might be good until the point, especially if you're sick. But then if you're really healthy, if you're excessively attached to the health, at some point you might find that it's actually making you unhealthy because you're kind of so much preoccupied and worried and stressing about it. So an auspicious attachment, if you're going to have an attachment in the Dharma, the one I'm going to read, this would be good. As long as it's good. And then you let go. So this is, I also, I call this poem the Vipassana anthem. So for the insight movement for us all, kind of like this has such a wonderful special place for us. And so there's four verses, four stanzas. Anywhere they appear, not faltering and not agitated, knowing this develop the mind. Ardently do what should be done today. Who knows death may come tomorrow. There is no bargaining with mortality and death's great army. Whoever lives thus ardent, active day and night, is, says the peaceful sage, one who has an auspicious day. So I think part of the power of this poem is the third stanza verse. Ardently do what should be done today. Who knows death may come tomorrow. There is no bargaining with mortality and death's great army. So, and here the lesson of this death contemplation, taking it into seriously, is not morbid, is not kind of, you know, and it's not meant to live in such a way that you have a better rebirth, something. But rather to take this moment seriously as the place for practice, as a place to be mindful and attentive. And more than that, this is the place to have insight. And that if you can have insight here, if you're able to live really centered here, as life is being lived in the lived moment, the lived life, and have insight as you go along, then this is an auspicious day, says the peaceful sage. Peaceful sage is a word for the title for the Buddha, but the word peaceful is important because this is the purpose of this path. This is the purpose of this auspicious practice, is so we can discover for ourselves a deep abiding sense of peace. One of the great gifts that we can give the world is to die peacefully, if it's possible. It helps people not be afraid of life. There's been lots of studies done that have pointed out that something like, there's a tendency for the people who are afraid of death to be afraid to live their life fully. And the people who are not afraid of death tend to live a fuller, more engaged life. Exactly how to explain that, I don't know, but it's an interesting correlation. And so it starts with this kind of instructions of don't chase the past or long for the future. The past is left behind in the future, not yet reached. One of the lessons that I learned slowly over the years was when I thought about the future, imagined the future, planned around the future, had wishes and fears about the future, I had plenty of it for all kinds of situations. And it turned out I had an amazingly poor prediction rate that I would predict, you know, based on some idea of what was going to happen in the future. And so many times it didn't work out that way. It did happen differently than I was planned or how I thought or was afraid. And so it slowly dawned on me that I had very bad record. And even then it took a long time for that to sink in deeply. And eventually I realized, oh, I don't know the future. And so I'm not going to be so attached to it or so caught in my prediction. I might take it into account and, you know, do some modicum of at least bring an umbrella or something. But in case, but the it kind of loosened up my way as I was attached to the future, cut up in the future, concerned about the future. And I discovered as I learned to let go of that pre-concern, the preoccupation with my future, and I would show up. And I discovered that generally once I'm there in the moment, I generally know how to find my way with it and then help me relax even more. And the result of that relaxation was a greater appreciation and willingness just to be with here with what's going on, be present. So the future is not yet reached. The past is left behind. And, you know, I've held on to the past. Not wanting to let go and not wanting, you know, I hold on to the memories, hold on to the people, hold on to whatever it were, who I was back then. And sometimes it's held me back. Sometimes my self-image of myself was based on who I was in the past. And I'm still trying to prove that or be that. And it's kind of interfered with my ability to be present here in a full way. Don't chase the past or long for the future. So when the Buddha, after he gave this poem and wanted to suit his word appears in, he then gives an explanation of what it means. And I want to explain that to you if I can, but I would like to do it first with an analogy. Many years ago I read of a study where some psychologist took an actor to give a talk at some significant conference. And after the actor gave this talk, they would interview the people coming out into the lobby. How was that? What did you think of that talk? And people would say, that was really great. It was wonderful. It was one of the best things happening at the conference. The thing was that the script the actor had been given to read or to present to the conference was nonsense. It didn't make any sense. And so there was something about the actor's delivery, something about the actor that led people to believe that there was something significant here being told. The article I read about it didn't say too much about the actor, but one of the things I imagined, I wouldn't be surprised, the actor was probably a tall, white, middle-aged man, a certain kind of person that tends to be given a lot of authority automatically when they show up. Unfortunately, people like me, maybe sometimes. And perhaps the person had a great melodious voice, who was really enjoyable to listen to them, and could speak with great confidence as an actor, right? Like they really knew what they were talking about. And I can imagine, for example, maybe they dropped certain words, got repeated. Maybe the word peace got repeated. But the sentence didn't make any sense, but people hear the word peace. And so they were, oh, peace. Oh, yeah, peace. And they'd be reminded, and then they left. They thought, that's what they were left with. This guy talked about peace. I'm so glad people did it. They had such conflict. And so in this scenario, some of the audience are making certain things up. First, they're making things up based on appearance. Appearance of who the person is, based on their voice, their sound. And that's just what's being approached. And they're making something up. Maybe the researchers wanted people to make it up. But still, the audience was actively involved by their own background and predispositions, making up some idea of who this person was. This is an authoritative person speaking authoritatively. They were also making up that it was pleasant, enjoyable. Maybe because of this dial delivery, maybe the person was animated in a wonderful way. Maybe the voice was really pleasant to listen to. And so they were making up this idea, this is a really pleasant event to be here. I really enjoy being here. Was the enjoyment really there? Or how much were responsible for the creation of it? They had concepts. They made up concepts. Oh, this person knows what he's talking about. This is a great talk. And they were making up these concepts that they were then living in. They also were making up all kinds of reactions and inner things in their mind. They were constructing universes of, you know, I'm so wonderful, I came out on time to the conference, I paid lots of money for it, this is a great thing, I can't wait until I go, you know, I don't know what. But making up a whole story, a little universe of what it means to be there and how wonderful it is. And then probably the knowing of it, the knowing all this also felt really good. Wow, I'm in the know now. My first Zen teacher had this way of talking about where Zen fit into current events, the world of current events. And he was, you know, friends with the governor and different people in Washington and famous people. So we were given this feeling as he spoke that our practicing Zen was on the forefront of our culture. And it was so good to know this, to be part of this. So that was kind of, you know, it was rather unfortunate. It was actually not so helpful for our Zen students to be caught in a grip of this kind of thing that being created. So these people, the audience was creating something. So I hope you appreciate that. And so we, our minds are creative. Our minds have an amazing capacity to make things up. And in fact, it needs to. It's doing it all the time. And generally, it's predictive ability to create images and ideas and is relatively good. Otherwise, you wouldn't have made it here today. You do just enough to find here. But sometimes how we create things gets in the way and causes us problems. So then this is how the Buddha, no, the Buddha didn't know the study, but what he said in explaining this, that chasing the past, what that means is, some translators reviving the past. What it means is that the idea of making up ideas of who we were in the past, making up the appearances that we had, making up, you know, I've seen in my life, I've reviewed my life in my old age now. I now will make up new ideas of what I was like in the past. You know, sometimes I tell myself, well, now I know better. Now I recognize who I was a long time ago. But do I really? It's kind of still kind of an appearance, making up an appearance somehow. And then making up sensations. You know, things in the past that were unpleasant at the time, now I'm grateful for and I see them as pleasant event. Or opposite happens. Something that was pleasant now is seen as unpleasant. So this idea of, you know, we are constructing the past, the concepts we have about the past changes and we make up new ideas, new concepts of it. The fish gets bigger by the telling, right? The new concepts of the fish, they say. And then our reactions and the story making mind that we live in changes over time about the past. And then our sense of knowing and how with the quality of knowing that happens as we know the past. So the Buddha specified these five different areas that people make things up. And so not chasing the past means don't make things up about yourself in the past this way. And longing for the future is the same thing about the future. Don't make things up about yourself about the future because you'll get in trouble for it. That's how we get, a lot of suffering can come from some fixed idea, this is who I am. I'm this way, I'm supposed to be this way, I should be this way. This is happening to me, I'm a victim to all this, you know, or I'm asserting myself, I'm supposed to have, I deserve things. There's a complicated world of self that we create that part of the function of mindfulness is to take a good look at and see, to discover, to really understand how it's working. And then here in the text it goes on and says, clearly see phenomena anywhere they appear. So what this means is, is to stay in the present moment enough that you see what's happening as it's occurring. The constant flow and change. Oftentimes we live retrospectively or, you know, in the present moment, like something happens and then we spend the world thinking about it. There's not a few times that I've noticed that someone is talking and I'm beginning to thinking about something and I realize, I didn't hear what they were saying for a while. And it happens the most for me occasionally, I hope, when I'm on Zoom, especially with a group of people. You know, somehow I think about something, I've gotten distracted or something's happened and I'm in my world of thinking. And so I'm not there as it's occurring. Maybe someone said something and now I find myself reflecting on it and now I'm lingering in the past. But this ability to really stay here in the present moment is where we see insight. That's kind of the key thing about this Vipassana practice we do, is to not just see what's happening, not just to see what's here, but to see it as it's happening. And you can't see it as it's happening if we're living in the constructs the mind makes, the concepts it lives in. If you see a river going by and you just think, that's a river, and you live in the concept of the river, you might not notice what the river is, it's constantly flowing. You can kind of get into your head, oh, that's a river, maybe I should go swimming in it, I didn't bring a bathing suit, I don't have a bathing suit, where am I going to get a bathing suit? It'd be great to go in the river. Yeah, I bet it's nice and comfortable, I love swimming, I'm such a great swimmer. And we're living in a world that we're making up, in a sense, of thought. And we've loose touch with the actual experience of the river. We're relating to it, but now it's relating through the conceptual mind, the story making mind. But to really be in the experience of the river, what you'll see is the river is constantly flowing. And that's a very different way of experiencing a river than all the stories we're making up around it. And we're doing Vipassana, that's where we kind of want to try to rest in, especially meditation, is in the, as things occur, as things are happening, this is where we have insight. So then the Buddha goes on and he says in the poem, not faltering and not agitated, knowing this developed the mind. So this is not just simply to be in the present moment, for the present moment's sake, but that we're actually learning to develop ourselves, to become a stronger mind, clear mind, more centered mind, more receptive mind. There's all kinds of ways the mind gets developed. And as it does so, the qualitative way in which we can live our life now, be attentive and be present, changes. So that as the quality of the mind increases, then we're able to move closer and closer to a time where we know what to let go of, so we can be at peace in this world, in the moment as it's occurring. Even if it's our last day, last minutes of life, we know how to be peaceful. We know this is what's possible. And to the Buddha in his explanation of this text, then he explains what he means by not faltering. And to not falter is as things are occurring in the present moment. We don't make a self in relationship to it. So as, for example, things appear, our appearances are there, say sensations are there, our thoughts are there. I saw that in my mind when I was meditating today. I sat down to meditate. And I could see for a while, in the first few minutes, I could see that I was teetering back and forth between being my thoughts and knowing that I was thinking. And I could easily slip back into just being my thoughts, so in a sense, I am my thinking, because that's where I was living. And then as I was settling, I could see, you know, I could know that my mind was thinking. I was kind of like, the image I had was I was kind of looking up to my mind and say, oh, the mind is thinking a lot. And that was a much better place to be. It was kind of interesting. Oh, my mind is thinking, look at that. It's like this, you know, the radio is on, as opposed to getting swept into the radio and kind of believing I'm the, I don't know what, I'm the thoughts. And so you can believe, for you're thinking, you know, I am my thoughts. You can believe the thoughts are part of me. The thoughts are in me. The thought, you know, there's all these senses of self we create in relationship to our thoughts, to our feelings, to our perceptions, to our thought ideas, to our being conscious. And again, it's a made-up mind. It's a constructive, creative mind. And for the Buddha, this idea that we create a self, an identity around it, it's different than having an identity. So, you know, some of us have identities, which are obvious to some of us, these to ourselves, and that we kind of need to have it. You know, we can find certain parts of the world we need to kind of behave accordingly, according to our identity. Some are role identities. Some are gender identities. It used to be they had male and female bathrooms. And once upon a time, by mistake, I went into the women's bathroom. This was not a good thing. And no one saw me, but I realized when I walked out that, uh-oh, I could have gotten big trouble for this. So you're supposed to kind of behave, you know. Know certain things about the identity. So some of it we're born with in all kinds of ways, but some of it is made up. So if I'm, you know, an identity I kind of have, especially sitting here giving a Dharma talk, is I'm a Buddhist teacher. So it's okay. I think you're kind of going along with it, so it's okay for now. It has a purpose. But when I go home, my wife and my kids, guess what identity is no longer relevant? Once upon a time, 25 years ago, when I started to teach, I came home to my wife. We were talking and she stopped me and said, Gil, you're using that voice. I was using the teacher voice for her. You know, that's not the place to be a teacher, right? So sometimes we get in trouble. We have these identities, but we use them inappropriately. We hold onto them. We attach them. Some identities are value judgments. I'm a lousy person. I'm a bad person. I'm a right good person. I'm the best person. I'm this kind of person, you know. And so we live in these values of ourselves, and some people, it's tremendously heavy the weight they carry, the negative identities they're holding for themselves. You know, I'm, I mean, for me, you know, some of you heard this before, when I was in my 20s, I thought that Gil was short for guilt. Because I didn't have to do anything to be guilty. I just was. And if I did something, then I was guilty. But I didn't, you know, like I remember seeing it really clearly. This is where I, it was by doing meditation practice that I saw it so clearly, because I was walking across the meditation hall floor when people were meditating, and just walking across the floor, I was guilty. I mean, what am I guilty for? How about just walking, you know. But it was such a strong tendency of mine. So the identity of being the guilty one was strong for me. So I'd taken on that burden, that kind of identity. So for the Buddha, not faltering is not to take on, make up, and live in these made up identities and be attached to them. The attachment to self is a problem. The attachment to seeing how this works, to being in the present moment, moment, moment, seeing things that they occur, seeing how attachments occur, to see the arising of a story, the arising of a made up idea. Oh, here it's occurring. And this is one of the values of really being present as things are occurring, is you have a better chance to notice when we start making up stories, making up identities, making up these things that we're living in. And then we can put a question mark next to it. Is this really useful? Is this true? Maybe I don't need to do this. So you're trading one attachment for another, a painful one that's painful for you and sometimes for others, for an attachment which is the opposite, is when it's beneficial, develops the mind. Not faltering, not getting hung up, not agitated. Identity that we make up trips people up and makes people agitated. And you can see it a little bit, some of us, some of you maybe, if people either praise you or condemn you, I bet you either falter or get agitated. If you get praised, the agitation is kind of a good agitation. It feels good. Wow. If they criticize you, it's like a bad agitation. Or you're faltering, you know, now that I'm so great, I have to keep it up. And then we're tripped up, we're tripped up or something. So this power of this mindfulness practice is that of cutting through the ways we get caught in identity and concepts in this made-up world that's actually a much bigger part of our life than most people realize. And so to develop the mind is to have this clear capacity for insight, this clear ability to name and see and see through it. And for what purpose? So we can relax. Relax deeply, deep enough to experience a deep, abiding sense of peace. Ardenly do what should be done today. Who knows, death may come tomorrow. There's no bargaining with mortality and death's great army. Since there's no bargaining, no escaping death, for the Buddhist point of view, this is what's worth doing. This moment, this minute, this time, this day, is when we have our lived life. Live it fully, but not greedily, like live it fully to have, you know, by going to Disneyland or something. Live it fully by waking up, being really present for the lived moment. The lived moment is more exciting than Disneyland. Whoever lives thus ardent, active day and night, is, says the peaceful sage, one who has a auspicious day. So this is the Vipassana anthem. We know that the Buddha encouraged people to memorize it. Maybe you'll memorize it. And so those are my thoughts for today. So do you have any comments you'd like to make or any questions about this? Is there anything else? Good morning. So this is a somewhat minor piece of what you were talking about, but you mentioned sometimes, especially on Zoom, you're somebody's talking and then you're thinking about some reflecting on something else that they said or whatever it is, getting distracted by some thoughts. And I just wonder in those situations, like sometimes is it skillful to just try to slow the conversation down to? Because I noticed sometimes for me it's hard because maybe that reflection needed some time to, maybe it was an important reflection and then the conversation is just moving on. And yeah, does that make sense? It makes a lot of sense. And for you to be tracking yourself well enough to know what you need in order to participate in that conversation is a really important skill to have. And whether it's appropriate to ask for things to slow down or not for you, it depends whether it's one-on-one and you're talking about something really important interpersonally, that's completely good. Or I've been involved in conversations where someone is moving on very quickly and I said we have to make an important decision or something and I've explicitly asked sometimes can we slow down? I need to track this much better and can we go over this again or something? Can you repeat this, what you said? So I think that's a really useful skill when to do it and when not to it. If it's that big conference with a thousand people there and to ask the person's presenting, say it's not nonsense, it's really good, to ask them to slow down for your sake and you're one out of a thousand people might be a disservice to everyone else, makes the whole thing more difficult for everyone else. So you have to kind of understand the context, situation, but I love it that you're asking this and there are times when that's really healthy. That's good? And then hopefully the people you're with appreciate that because that's part of the context. Can we slow down? And that person doesn't have the ability for that or somehow it takes it too personally like they've done something wrong and it just makes the whole situation more difficult than it had to be. So understanding context is such an important part of living a wise life. Yeah, I mean I think maybe one more piece that I'm reflecting on is maybe sometimes I need to take care of it in some way, like write down a quick note or something about an insight that I had so that I can not keep turning on it and then be able to return to what's happening now because it's not the appropriate time. Yeah, there have been some things, I've done a few things to help me be present. Sometimes I have taken notes as I listen. If there's a long presentation because taking notes, I don't really need to take notes but by taking notes I stay present more actively and I'm less likely to wander off. And the other thing I do is I make sure I sit straight on Zoom because if I kind of relax and sit back, I'm more likely to mind and more likely not to be present fully for the experience, to track it. Hi, thank you for the talk. Somehow I find it a little bit remote from the reality as if we're living in this paradise where everybody is peaceful and there's no problems, no protests, nothing like this. So it feels a little bit theoretical perhaps and makes me wonder, have you ever participated in any sort of protest? In what? Protest, like protesting against something. And how would that go? And I guess I would like to hear some sort of example of how to do more of a peaceful protest perhaps. Like the world is full of problems and we do not live in paradise, so to speak. Do you understand what I'm saying? Yeah, very much so. But I think that what it's inspired to do is to kind of put it back on you that if you think we live in paradise here in Silicon Valley, you're not looking. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying the opposite actually. Listening to this poem, it's great. I mean, it feels to me that it would be great to follow this poem if we were living in paradise, but unfortunately we're not living in paradise. And thus, this prioritizing this peaceful being and stuff like that, that just seems to be like some sort of fairy tale, I guess. Do you see what I'm saying? I understand what you're saying, but I don't see the logic of it. Because in my logic, that if you can do this, if you can really be present enough to watch how you construct your reality, your life, then you can be peaceful in the middle of conflict. Then you're in a much better position to be able to do things wisely when things are really difficult and challenging. It's the people who don't know themselves well and can't track their reactions, their responses internally, who when there's conflict and difficulty, even if they go to a protest, they're peaceful for a while, but then someone kind of yells, you know, you're crazy, protesting, and before they know it, they're punching the person out. They're suddenly reactive. So I think that this here is a recipe for responsible engagement in the world and the challenges. And I'm staking my life not on making people some kind of retired enlightenment that they just sit and stay home and do, wertel. But I want this practice to be one that makes people change agents for a peaceful world. And right here in Silicon Valley, there's like a fifth of the people here in Silicon Valley are hungry. That's a very high percentage. Go visit Second Harvest. They're one of the premier organizations here that are nonprofit that's trying to bring food to the hungry. And there's a huge population of people that they're feeding. So it's right here, close by. Thank you. Do you have time for one more thought? Yeah. I get what you were saying. I thought that was an astute observation about the practicality of this very wise poem. And it just dawned on me there's a real world example that's been unfolding globally, right, for the past, I don't know, nine months. It's, I appreciate what you were saying, Gil, about us being creative beings. We are talking a recession into existence. Why? Right? Maybe we should be talking something else into existence. But it's becoming, well, I don't believe it, but others believe it's a self-fulfilling prophecy, a recession's coming, a recession's coming. Why don't we all collectively try to think of the opposite, or maybe think of nothing, and then see what happens? I just found this to be a very timely poem that you shared. Yeah, there's so many things that we actually think into existence, much more than people realize. Some things are self-fulfilling prophecies. And so if we believe certain things, then everything organizes around that, and so it becomes true. And known people who I've seen who are aversive people, they're very angry, and so they have this idea that everyone else is out to get them, everyone else is mean, but they're more angry. But then when they go someplace, they have this atmosphere of anger around them, and then people are treating them unkindly. So it's fulfilling the very things that they're afraid of or they want. So the power of this creative mind is quite something. So this practice of clearly see phenomena anywhere they appear, really be present. Phenomena means as your experience is happening, as your inner life gets born, to really see it clearly is such a relief, is so needed for our society. I've put a tremendous amount of hope in having people become healthy in this way. Great. So may you have an auspicious day. Thank you very much. And if you want to stay around a little bit and say hello to each other, maybe you can say hello to the person next to you and say goodbye. But it's nice to have a little bit of community.
