 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello and welcome. And so it's a time to perhaps be a bit quiet internally, to sit and meditate, and to bring mindfulness to our experience, to bring awareness, attention. And it seems that in the teachings of the Buddha, water is used as a simile metaphor for awareness. And when we begin practice, maybe there are capacity to be mindful, to be consciously aware, are brief. And maybe it's more like moments that we sprinkle into the situation. So sprinkling awareness into our life. And maybe that's also kind of a nice image, that has kind of been places where Buddhist monastics have sprinkled water on people's heads as a blessing, kind of sprinkling awareness on our experience. As the moments of awareness become more continuous, awareness becomes more like flowing water. And it flows over and through and around our experience. Or our experience, yeah, it's kind of being washed by awareness, or floating in awareness. And then you have flowing water. It doesn't stop for anything. If it's a dam, it builds up to the top of the dam and spills over. But eventually it finds its way downhill. And it can be soft, but over time it's very powerful. Wearing away the hardest granite, wearing away the hardest attachments we have. As we let the water flow through and wit. And water doesn't complain about things, it just flows. Water doesn't attach to anything, it just flows. And then at times, water enters into a large, large lake where the water becomes really still and quiet. And peaceful, quiet, transparent water is how mindfulness awareness can become when it becomes well developed. When all those moments of continuity really come together and there's no more reinforcing or bringing more attention and energy to it. Awareness is just there. And to abide, to dwell in this kind of lake-like, oceanic-like awareness is also possible. And so in other ways as well, the Buddha uses water as a similean metaphor. And so as we sit today, perhaps you can keep close by the simile at the metaphor of water for the awareness that you are evoking, bringing forth for this present moment experience. Water flowing along with the breathing. Water sprinkled in. Water as the vast space, spaciousness, vast stillness in which everything floats. Everything floats in its own way. And when everything individually floats in the vast space of awareness, for the Buddha there's a lot of equanimity that comes along. So being equanimous about all things. So with that, that's kind of the idea for today. Mostly we'll sit quietly. So you might, if you haven't already, gently close your eyes. And if your mind, awareness, heart is like agitated water, taking a long, deep breath, and then the exhale, let it all settle. Let it all settle. Letting breathing return to normal. Bringing awareness to your body, breathing, sometimes intermittently like water sprinkled in blessings on yourself. Other times more continuous and flowing, moving, than other times everything floats, allowing to be as it is in a vast body of water, vast body of awareness. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. If you find yourself agitated or caught up in thoughts or feelings or body sensations, imagine that it's floating in an ocean, a wide lake of water. It's allowed to be there, but it's allowed to float all by itself. It doesn't have to influence you or affect you. It doesn't have to go away, but it's held in a wide, vast field, lake of awareness. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. Breathing. As we come to the end of the sitting, to again give some thought or image to water. Maybe and how if you put your hand, touch your hand to water, the water doesn't resist the hand. But it does surround it. In a sense, the water touches the hand completely thoroughly, but offers no resistance. So when sounds come, sensations come, feelings, thoughts come. It's possible to have no resistance. Allow them to come and the water changes its shape to receive whatever comes into it. At the same time, so your water, your awareness receives, doesn't resist, but it also can be intimate with everything. Non resisting and in contact, touching. And to go into the world without resistance, but with a heart that can shift and change and adapt and move with whatever comes. It doesn't resist, but doesn't lose itself and remains in a certain way connected, connected at the heart. And may it be that this practice that we do teaches us how to care for ourselves and others by not resisting while staying connected. It teaches us how to be safe by not resisting, but staying warm and kind and friendly. It teaches us to be peaceful by not contending and complaining and grasping. And may it be that this what we learn about being present can be a benefit for this world. May it be that our ability to attend, to be mindful is for the welfare and happiness of all. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. Thank you.
