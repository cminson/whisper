Let's take a moment to notice what the body is like, without judgements, without buyers or preference, so how is it? How is the mind? What's our mood like right now? Do we feel sleepy, alert, we feel cheerful, scattered, depressed, excited? How is it? There's no right or wrong mood, just as with the body, there's no wrong place to start. 
Let's start from where we are, from how things are configured in this moment. 
Let's take a moment to look, to feel, what's the mood of the mind right now, before we try to do anything with it? How is it? What's the material that we're working with, like a potter, eating familiar with the clay? What's its texture? Let's feel what we're working with. 
Our Buddhist meditation has many facets, many different purposes, it can be useful, many different methods. 
But of all of these, the most central qualities, the most essential benefit that we can derive from Buddhist practice, meditation, is to draw upon some of the intrinsic qualities of mind and to develop them. 
The mind has the capacity to be awake, to be aware, to know. 
We can use meditation to consciously cultivate that quality of wakefulness, alertness, bringing attention to this present reality. 
The mind also has the capacity for peacefulness, for steadiness, a quality of calm, focused attention. 
The mind can rest, be fully focused on one thing upon this present reality, with peace, serenity, complete ease. 
For these are natural qualities of the mind, their attributes of the mind, and they can be developed, strengthened, brought to a full fruition. 
A mind and body relate to each other very closely, with a very deep, direct connection. 
How the body is affects the mind, how the mind is affects the body. 
They work together, at the lungs and the heart, the stomach and your liver, it's a different faculties that function very much in relationship to each other, they work together. 
So if we wish to establish, develop a mind which is alert and awake, then how we hold the body, what we do with the body affects that. 
Bringing attention then to the spine, feeling the presence of your backbone, invite your body to sit in an upright, alert way, to let the spine, to invite the spine to stretch to its full, comfortable limit, not to be tense or rigid or uptight, but just letting the body grow, lengthen, stretch till the spine is full, comfortable, natural limit. 
As the spine lengthens, grows, stretches in this way, notice how immediately that lends a quality of a greater alertness, sense of energy and brightness of mind, helps us to wake up, even just a little bit. 
Leaving the presence of the spine as the center, the axis of our physical world, then we invite the rest of the body to relax, to soften around that, to be free of tension, to settle. 
I just as the lengthening and stretching of the spine encourages alertness and awareness, and the relaxation of the body, the softening of the muscles in your face, shoulders, your belly, your legs, and encourages the quality of peacefulness, of calm. 
Now first of all bring attention to the feelings in your face, your forehead, around your eyes, your mouth, notice any feelings of tension, rigidity, tightness there, let those muscles relax, give yourself permission to let the muscles of the face be soft, restful, let the tension around your eyes and your mouth soften, dissolve away. 
As the muscles relax, notice that there is an effect upon the mood, the eyes and the jaw, the mouth soften, relax. 
Does this have an impact on the mind's feeling of ease or calm, how is it, what is the effect of that relaxation, and letting the attention flow down through the body, moving gently down our neck into our shoulders, notice the sensations that are there as we bring attention to that area, the shoulders soften, relax, drop down a notch or two, often we go through life with our back tense and hunched shoulders up around our ears, we are in a safe place, surrounded by good people, there is nothing we have to be worried about, nothing we have to generate tension, stress about, your shoulders relax, your arms hang easily loosely by your sides, and letting his wave of relaxation then gently continue to flow down, your left arm and your right arm, relaxing them too, whether you have your hands in your lap or in your knees or wherever you choose to have them is not important the exact way we hold them, let the arms and hands be free of any kind of tension and tightness. 
Feeling the trunk of the body, your chest, your stomach, solar plexus, the whole central core of our physical world, the shoulders drop back a little, the heart be more open, by yourself to breathe a little more easily, letting the stomach spreads, relax, soften, this is the opposite of the abs of steel program, this is the abs of jello, you can let your stomach spill out over the waist of your trousers or your skirt, no tension, relaxed, completely at ease. 
Letting this wave flow down to the hip joints, the pelvis, letting your thighs, legs drop an inch or two, knees, lower legs, relaxing the whole lower part of the body, all the way down to our feet, to our toes, making friends with this body, this constant companion, this vehicle of our life, to relate to it in a friendly, kindly, compassionate way, giving it permission to rest, to settle, to be fully at ease. 
For the next few minutes, then let the attention sweep slowly up, down through the body, feeling out all the different corners, notice how the body has changed, sometimes when we are engaged in relaxing our legs, our hip joints, our eyes have scrunched up again, our jaws tightened, and while we are relaxing our jaw, our eyes, then the stomach has gone rigid once more, let it take the next couple of minutes to slowly, steadily, gently sweep the attention through the body, and wherever you find that tension or tightness has reasserted itself, let the mind rest at that spot, invite the body to soften, to be free of tension once again, so we are holding the whole body within awareness, accepting it as it is, feeling its presence, knowing it, accepting it. 
The mind in its pure state, the mind free of greed, hatred and delusion, is both perfectly awake, energetic, bright, and completely peaceful, completely relaxed. 
In the ordinary way of thinking of things, we think of peace or relaxation as being curled up in a heap on the sofa, snoozing on a long and lazy weekend, alertness we associate with negotiating with the traffic on highway 17, going to a scary movie, and something's exciting, frightening, irritating, the mind is alert. 
But beneath all that, behind all those superficial reactions, conditioned reactive habits of mind, the very fundamental nature of mind at its basis, is both alertness and total peacefulness, working together, coexisting, not conflicting. 
As we establish this quality within the posture, the body both energetic and upright, fully relaxed, that supports the realisation, the embodiment of those qualities on the mental level as well. 
It helps us to find those aspects of mind that are also both completely peaceful, completely awake. 
Our mind's tendency is to drift, we remember things, we anticipate things, we hear sounds and create trains of thoughts and stories triggered by what we hear, what we remember, what we imagine, the mind drifts into agitation, and the other direction drifts into sleepiness, things are quiet and still, serene, next thing we know we dozed off, nothing interesting nothing exciting, so click, we switch off, therefore it's important for us to notice that drift, maybe for a moment we find we're able to sustain that beautiful balance of alertness and peacefulness, and then we drift, the mind dozes off, shuts down, find ourselves drooping over the spine no longer straight, the head have fallen forwards, the mind's gone into a dull, heavy nebulous, sleepy state. 
Or it's drifted into agitation, body tense, rigid, the mind busy, planning, thinking, worrying, remembering, so we use ways to notice that drift, the most simple and straightforward way of seeing that happen, catching it as it begins, is to focus the attention on a single object, to take a simple neutral reference point, there are many different things one can use, a mental image or a mantra word, different ideas, like loving kindness, but the most simple and accessible, usable for most people, is to simply focus the attention on the natural rhythm of your breathing, breath is always with us, the body breathes on its own, there's no thing that we have to will on a personal level, the body does it by itself, awake, asleep, keeps breathing, breath is not exciting, so it takes effort to bring attention to it, but that application of effort helps to brighten, strengthen the quality of awareness, bringing attention to your breathing then, not trying to change it or fix it, do anything with it, you don't have to breathe in a special way, long or deep, short, let the breath come and go as it chooses, set that pattern of feeling, the in breath, the out breath, set that right at the center of your attention, it's like being at the very heart of a mandala, put the breath right at the very center of attention, for these next few minutes, make the resolution, right now there's nothing I need to plan, nothing I need to remember, nothing I need to figure out, no problems I need to solve, all of that can wait at least 10 or 15 minutes, the world can wait, consciously put everything else aside, set the intention to focus on the rhythm of the breathing, feeling the in breath, beginning to its end, the out breath, from its beginning to its end, very quickly many of us have been practicing this kind of meditation for many years, some of us are completely new to it, by the way very quickly we'll notice that the mind obeys orders for a very brief period, then up pops the thought and the attention gets pulled away, we drift off into a memory, find ourselves getting sleepy, so by having a clear reference point we can notice when that drift begins, if you're off planning next week that means you're not on the breath, you're hearing somebody snoring very close by, that might be you, we bring attention to the breathing, simply so that it's a marker, a reference point to see the coming and going of each moment, as the mind is pulled away, distracted by thoughts and feelings, moods, as I was saying yesterday we don't want to make the mind into the enemy or a problem that we have to fight against, but rather like working, training a young child, gently, firmly, we put the crayon in her hand, hold her hand in ours and make the shape of the letters, gently, firmly, calmly, when the mind runs off and gets carried away, gently, patiently, gather it back in, ready to begin again endlessly, so we're learning how to work with the nature of the mind, its habits and character, rather than setting up an opposition against it, seeing the mind get carried away, notice that, let go, letting go, then bringing the attention back to the very center, back to the feeling of the breath once again, to train ourselves to notice, distraction is like this, letting whether this is the first time we've ever sat on a retreat or done this kind of meditation, whether we've been doing this for decades, maybe we've heard these kind of instructions a thousand times, ten thousand times, whether it's very familiar or completely new, it's up to us to make use of this moment, how is the mind right now, how's the body, can hear the instructions and go, oh yeah, right, great, three seconds later, back into our streams of habit, whether it's all familiar or completely unfamiliar, somewhere in between, it's up to us, each one of us, to take responsibility, how we use this moment, how is the body right now, is it tense and rigid, is it flopped over and slumped, or is it balanced, alert, energetic, but relaxed, how is it, are we focused on the breath, or have we drifted somewhere else, how is it, no matter how many times we lose it, the attention gets carried away, snagged on the passing thought, like a burr getting caught on our socks, snagged and carried miles away, as soon as you notice, let go, unpick the burr, come back to the centre, if the mind gets frustrated and full of self criticism, oh it's just useless, my mind's all over the place, I'm a hopeless meditator, just notice that's the I'm the hopeless meditator thought, it arises, passes away, we don't have to believe it, we don't have to make much of it, this is more about learning how to lose it, how to recognise that drift, how to let go and begin again, it's more about learning to fail perfectly than to force the mind to behave in a certain way, we fail, we lose it, we notice, we let go, we begin again, fresh, open, nothing lost, just like all other wonky lines that a child makes when trying to draw the A's and B's and C's, they're not lost, they're not wasted, they're part of the learning process.

Dās pöintīn tú yesterday, it helps us enormously to shift the perspective from me working with my problems, me dealing with my busy mind, to seeing it in terms of the Buddha knowing the dhamma, the wisdom mind knowing the way things are. 
So rather than the mind framing things in terms of me in my pain, pain in my leg, me in my obsessive thinking, to catch, to notice that pattern of attitude, to see how a feeling of self, of I and me and mine, is being created, pasted on to the experience. 
And when that's peeled away, what's found is, well, more accurately there's the experience of pain in the leg right now. 
It's the experience of a chattering mind right now. 
It's the hearing of Ajahn Amaro's voice right now. 
It's the wisdom mind attending to the way things are. 
It doesn't have to be cast into the mould of I and me and mine, me doing something to get some result. 
Rather, here is the awake wisdom mind knowing this moment, knowing the patterns of the experiential world like this. 
And when that self-creating, that self-forming habit is let go of, notice what happens. 
When it's shifted from me and my problematic chattering mind to here's the experience of the chattering mind. 
Notice if there's a shift, how different that is. 
There's a spaciousness, a coolness, a diminishing of stress within the system. 
As soon as the I and me and mine, the ahankara, mamankara, I-making and mind-making is let go of, the experience of the present becomes far more clear, open, peaceful, free. 
Even if what is being felt is a discomfort in the body or a afflicted emotion, a feeling of fear or jealousy, irritation, there's space around it, space within it. 
It's recognized as a pattern of nature, arising and passing away rather than me and mine or some personal attribute or some kind of personal possession. 
So as we sit for the next couple of minutes before the bell, just notice the habits of mind, the self-creating habits of mind. 
See if they can be let go of, not me anticipating the bell, but just awareness of anticipation. 
If we can notice that, see how that feels, what's the difference in quality and the experience of the present is not clouded, occluded by I and me and mine. 
Even if it's just for half a second, notice how that is. 
Just for a finger snap, that self-creation is interrupted. 
How is it? What is its quality? How is it? How is it? How is it? How is it? How is it? We will do some walking meditation now for the next 45 minutes from 9. 
30 to 10. 
15. 
Since this is the first retreat for some people and I can give a little description of walking meditation, this particular style of Thai forest tradition, the walking meditation method that we use is just to walk at an ordinary, gentle, natural pace. 
In fact, it's encouraged not to walk in slow motion, just to pretend that you're going for a stroll in the park, that you're not doing walking meditation, but just walking. 
And that framework of walking, we set up a stretch of ground that we got a nice area around us as Gil was pointing out, please don't go out on the roads or the lane, but in the area around the building or within the building, there's even a walking room next door and in the grounds around the building, in the woods, find a stretch of ground about 50-60 feet long, 70 feet long, so about 25 yards long if you can find a stretch of ground. 
And then to designate, okay, I walk from this rock to this tree and this wall to that wall and then make that the framework for the walking period. 
So just as sitting on the mat, sitting on the cushion, this is our framework for the sitting meditation period. 
You designate this is my framework for the walking meditation period and try to find a walking path that doesn't cross anybody else's, so that you're not kind of going at right angles. 
You might think, why does he need to say that? But the experience has shown that the record I've seen is someone who chose a path that crossed three other peoples. 
It's like a quadrill, you know, this kind of military maneuvers. 
It was extraordinary, but it's not necessary. 
You've got plenty of room here, so please choose a path that doesn't collide or cross with somebody else's. 
And also there is probably a perfect path somewhere, but you don't need it. 
Just find a good enough path rather than the perfect path. 
So once you've chosen a path to walk on, just stay with that for the period of time and even though it might not be the perfect one is over there somewhere, leave it be, the path you've chosen is definitely good enough. 
And so maybe I'll just give a little demonstration for whom this is all new.
