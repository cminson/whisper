Last year, for Martin Luther King's holiday, I gave a talk that was more kind of thematic
about Martin Luther King, and in some ways I wish I would do that again this year, today.
It's my favorite American holiday, and I feel that the values that Martin Luther King
based his life on are very much aligned with the Buddhist values, and make some sense for
Buddhists to celebrate him and talk about him. But it's not the talk that I have today, and what
I'd like to do is try to give a series of talks, starting tonight, and then maybe for another
night or two, I don't know, on the Buddhist topic of an anata, which is the subject of,
which is usually translated as not self, sometimes as no self, and it's a theme which,
in some ways, is very important for Buddhists, and it's something which confuses a lot of people,
and infuriates others. How could this, no self teaching, what's that about? Of course,
it's self. When I have an itch, I don't scratch my neighbor's cheek. I'm the one who has the
itch, I'm the one who scratches. So I thought it's a big topic, and I think it's a very
interesting one for practitioners. And today's talk is a little bit of an introduction to
the background to prepare for that. And one of the things I want to say is that if you
read the original sutras, Discourses of the Buddha, where this teaching of not self appears,
you find a lot of different teachings. It's a big, big collection of teachings, and you
find a wide range of teachings there. But one of the themes that threads through these
Discourses of the Buddha is the idea that a person who becomes a mature practitioner,
a person who develops the path far, attains a degree of mastery over his or her mind.
And the idea of mastery is a very strong one. And you find in the tradition, in the ancient
Discourses, that someone who has mastered their mind, who has tamed their mind, has learned
how to work with their mind, you find a lot of languages, a lot of expressions, descriptions
of strength or power, or powerful words to describe that person. So like the word arhat,
which is the traditional word for an enlightened person. After the Buddha, everybody who is
enlightened after the Buddha, fully enlightened, is called an arhat. And an arhat means a worthy
one, sometimes worthy. And in a very couple of places in the sutras, an arhat or the Buddha
also is called a maha atta, a great self. It's kind of the same title as mahatma gandhi,
same same idea. And sometimes they're called the whole last chapter of the Dhammapada,
where mature practitioners are called brahmins. Brahmins are kind of the priestly caste,
the upper caste in ancient India, and still in India, I guess. And it's kind of someone
who's proud, dignified, and someone who's matured in the practice is sometimes called
a brahmin. Sometimes you find languages of royalty associated with maturing your practice,
but the person who is going to engage in the practice is like a king or a queen, a royal
person who's going to go in and into the jungle, for example, and find their way, an ancient
path that's mostly overgrown, and clear that path, we clear that path, and we claim an
overgrown kingdom, which is deep in the jungle. So the practitioners are likened to king
or queen, royalty. And some of the qualities that are being developed in the practice are
also likened to that of being a king, king with his ministers. Occasionally you find
languages of being a warrior, warrior language associated with the maturing of this path.
So what's being described here as a mature person in the path is someone who develops
a degree of, I would say, some degree, strong degree of strength, personal strength, personal
power, personal mastery and ability. They're recognized as such, and they're celebrated
as such. When someone becomes enlightened, it's said that they can give the lion's roar.
And I once stood in front of the cage in the San Francisco Zoo. That was probably four
feet away. And just me and the lion. And my son, I was holding my little son, he was
maybe three years old, two years old. And there's the bars between us, luckily. But
there was no window, just the bars, right? And this big lion roared at us. And it was
like a primordial experience. I was just... I left. I mean, that really made a big impression
on me. So a lion's roar is when someone declares that they are enlightened. So again, a great
sense of strength. So it's a little bit kind of in the background of these kinds of teachings.
I don't know how Western Buddhist teachings come across. I know in some traditions, like
in certain Tibetan traditions, like Shambhala tradition, they also have the images of warrior
and mastery very much kind of built into that. I think that's kind of that particular
Buddhist tradition. But in the Western Vipassana tradition that I teach in, it's not that
often that we use that kind of language of mastery and developing personal power and
becoming a warrior, becoming like a king or queen, and become a great worthy person or
something. I don't think that so often. It's more likely you'll hear languages like practicing
self-acceptance. You know, there's a book, a popular book that popularizes this practice
called Radical Acceptance. It's a great book. We talk about the word acceptance, sometimes
the word allowing, having an allowing awareness, accepting awareness. There's a kind of feeling
of kind of being self-effacing. This not self-teaching is kind of like, well, you have to kind of
not have so much ego. Maybe you give up your ego and be soft, be kind, be gentle. You know,
you put together all these kinds of languages that some of us like me kind of use, sometimes
acceptance and allowing and kind and nonviolent and all these things. And you kind of start
getting a different kind of feeling tone to the kind of person where the path is taking
you than you do from the suttas, where the feeling tone is all the other kinds of words
like power and strength and royalty and Brahman and all these kinds of things. You following
me? So when the Buddha was teaching this teaching of for now called not self, it was also, you
know, to go together with this language of personal mastery, of personal strength. You
know, they didn't use the word personal strength and power, you know, real something. So probably
people didn't, you know, weren't so threatened by this idea of not self in the same way that
maybe some people here in the West were, well, if there's no self, I'm just going to give
up myself, then, you know, I'm just going to be this blob, you know, I'm going to be
pushed over, people are going to, you know, push me over easily, I won't be able to take
care of myself or defend myself and, you know, but if you get the sense of the some mastery
and power, you know, you can take care of yourself pretty well.
Thursday I went to Saint Quentin and met with a meditation group there, prisoners, and as
part of the meeting they talked about their practice and one of the common descriptions
of the practice that they gave us was they practiced a lot of letting go. They'd learned
through the practice, the Buddhist practice to let go. But what struck me was the, was
they talked about letting go, but what I picked up coming through them was a very strong sense
of strength and sense of strength and dignity that they seemed to have in the letting go.
They were asked in prison to let go of a lot of things and letting, and if you don't let
go, the consequences are really big for your well-being, for your, sometimes your health.
And so they've learned how to let go and in that learning, let go in very challenging
situations, they'd also become stronger people. So letting go wasn't just something where
you kind of diminished your, they weren't diminished by it, but letting go can also
be something where you're enhanced by letting go and become stronger. So that's what I picked
up when they talked about letting go, that they actually became stronger in the process
of learning how to let go. So I offer that as a background as we prepare to talk about
this teaching of not self. Now the next thing in preparation for teaching about not self
is to talk about meditation a little bit. And meditation is the meditative understanding
or meditative insight is the prerequisite for really understanding this teaching of
not self. I would venture, I go so far as to say that the teaching of not self is not
meant to be a philosophy, it's not meant to be a point of view that you then adapt and
say, oh yes, now I can apply that to everything, this is not self, this is not self, there's
no self here. And some people do that, they kind of go around, they kind of have some
kind of intellectual understanding of not self and they go around and they be a not
self person. It's irritating sometimes. There's no one there. You go out for dinner and they
say, well, what would you like to have for dinner? Oh, you know, I'm not really here
so I don't really have an opinion. And that's kind of irritating because you don't want
to choose for them. And so sometimes the intellectual adaptation of this not self teaching, which
some people do, actually goes against the grain of what this whole enterprise is about.
What I like to suggest is that the not self teaching is meant to be insights or understandings
that arise out of meditative experience. So it's not supposed to be something you have
to kind of study and get a dissertation on not self so you understand it, but rather it's
something you're supposed to meditate well in the meditation, then not self becomes
clear what it's all about. So probably I won't say anything anymore, it's complete
now, right? But I will still try to talk about it next few times.
So then to talk about meditation a little bit. It might be useful to think of the mind
as an orchestra and you're the conductor. So when you first sit down to meditate, your
orchestra is out of control, out of tune. And not only that, but they have difference,
each player has a different score, different music they're playing and going in all kinds
of different directions. Because you can feel how fragmented the mind is when you sit down
sometimes sit down to meditate. You sit down with very strong intention, for example, to
be present, to follow the breath. And even though you have all this intention, this great
wish and motivation, the compulsions of the mind are stronger than your intentions. And
so there's a kind of a fracturing or fragmentation or different agendas going, different music.
You have this one idea, the advertisement for the show said, you know, Bach. And you sit
down to listen to Bach and you get, I forget his first name, I think I'm thinking of Sapa.
And you know, it's not what you had in mind, not what you pay your money for. And sometimes
you don't realize that you're playing the wrong piece until someone rings the bell.
And they're, oh, wait a minute, that's not what I came to do. And but sometimes it's
worse, right? Because not just one impulse, you know, one compulsion, but several different
pieces of music come into play. And maybe they're playing, you know, different tracks
at the same time. But not the track you want. Never once in a while you remember, oh, that
happened on that track. I'm on the breath track. So you go back there. So that's one
thing that can happen. Some musicians are playing these different tracks of music. And
then there are, in the mind or in the body, the being, there is that kind of the track
your body's on. What's going on with your body? Sometimes your body's not in harmony
with what you want to do with developing concentration on the breath. So perhaps,
you know, your body can be wildly off. You know, maybe your body is really tense or contracted
in some way. And so it takes a while for the body to get relaxed enough and soft enough
so the body is in harmony with your intention to be focused on the breath. It's possible
to override the body if you have enough willpower. But I think that a really healthy meditation
doesn't override the body. It actually learns to work with the body so the body comes into
harmony with what we're trying to do here. But you sit down and you realize the body's
doing its own things, like different musicians, like the drummers off in the pit. And they're
kind of pounding away really loud. But who knows what music they're doing. And so that's
going on. And then there's your emotional state. You sit down to meditate and you're
here to stay with the breath. But there's this overriding emotional state from something
that happened early in the day. Someone made you really angry. Of course, you got really
angry with someone. And that anger has been simmering for hours. And even though it's
not always forefront in your mind, the concerns of anger, when you sit, you know, it's still
there. It's kind of like the mood that's always kind of there in the background, kind of
inter-preditating or the present. And so there's a strong mood that's there that has nothing
to do with focusing on the breath. There's a mood that's somehow casting an influence
on what's going on. It's playing its own music. As opposed to the emotional state being in
harmony with trying to focus on the breath. And there's a way in which the emotions can
actually be so very supportive of focusing on the breath, where they actually kind of
help usher you into the breath in a very concentrated way. But you have this ultimate momentum,
perhaps. For instance, there's also momentum in their emotional being from this anger they
had earlier today. And you can't just sit down to meditate and expect that momentum
to just drop away suddenly. It's like this big charge is built up and it takes a while
for the charge to dissipate. But then it might not just be one mood. It might be that, you
know, you're really angry at what happened earlier. But then there's another track that's
kind of going along next to it, another kind of emotional track, where you're anxious about
tomorrow. And so you're kind of flipping back and forth between the anger earlier and the
sphere. It's a completely different thing, but something's going to happen tomorrow.
And your mind kind of, it isn't just your thoughts are going there, but it also is influencing
your emotional state, this fear. And that's always kind of there. And so there's a little
bit of anger and a little bit of fear kind of here, kind of, you know, and they're playing
their music. And then there's your thoughts. You know, your thoughts can go in all kinds
of places, all kinds of directions. But more deeply than kind of a thought that's kind of
deep is also your beliefs. And there might be all kinds of beliefs that are not in harmony
with the music you want to play. And some beliefs, you know, for example, you might
have beliefs that, oh, I can't do this. This is too difficult for me. I'm going to do it.
I'll try it. Maybe it'll work today. But, you know, I'm not a really good meditator.
And, you know, it's like, you know, I'll give it the best shot I have, but it's not really
going to work, you know, or, you know, it'll just help a little bit that these teachers,
they say, you know, that, you know, it's always good to meditate. So I'm just going to do
it out of a sense of duty, but I just trust those teachers. But really, you know, I can't
really go very far. So that's a kind of belief that's there. And that's playing, it's kind
of a playing certain kind of music. Or there might be other beliefs that, you know, might
be, oh, if I do this meditation, then I will just be, you know, really successful at my
whatever, something in my life. And there's a belief that kind of, there's all kinds of
beliefs that come into play, but they're in the background. And some of the beliefs are
supportive of meditating. And some of them beliefs are wildly unsupportive, are not supportive
at all. I read some interesting studies last couple of days. See if I can, one of them
was an interesting one where they put people's heads, you know, with the bodies on them,
into this little chamber. And then they were going to tell them that they were going to
pass a current through their heads. And they were supposed to tell the experimenters something
like, you know, when the intensity got strong enough, it started to hurt, so they could
not do it any further, they wanted to measure at what point. And so I guess they had some
kind of light or meter that maybe in the little chambers, you can see the intensity or something.
And so the experimenters would push a button and then the different intensity levels would
go up and they would, and the subjects would report having feelings of charge going through
their head. And then at some point they said, that's strong enough, you know, they see intensity.
But in fact, there was no charge being passed through a chamber at all. Nothing is happening
at all. She said the meter was going up and down. And somehow their mind was creating
a charge. Another thing I read in the experiment, there's a book I'm reading about pain. And
apparently there's some experiments they did where thinking about, I guess you have an
injury someplace maybe, or thinking about that injury in a certain way, or thinking
about it can create the swelling to expand. You can swell more just out of thinking about
it. So, you know, what you think has a big impact. You can create, you know, all kinds
of stuff, like what you imagine or what you think or whatever. So what we believe is really
important. And so, you know, there's all the, you know, the violin section and the flute
section, you know, there are different beliefs, you know, they're playing different music.
And their music maybe is not very helpful. So here we have this orchestra that's playing
all this different music and a lot of it's out of tune anyway. And it's just a cacophony.
And it's not, you know, doing anything beautiful. But you're the conductor. And I like this
image of the conductor because in a sense the conductor is in charge. And we're asked,
in some ways, to take charge of the cacophony of our minds, the cacophony of our being.
We have to be very careful about taking charge, at least from the meditation's point of view,
because there are some ways of taking charge which just adds the cacophony, just adds greater
stress to the whole situation. But to some degree or other we're learning to take charge.
If it's nothing else, learning to let go. Or learning to show up. Okay. I'm just going
to show up in the present moment. That's my job. I'm going to show up. And in my image
of one way the conductor deals with this chaotic orchestra is the conductor gets up there on
the little stand and just stands there silently. And I've actually seen that where the orchestra
is getting ready to tuning their instruments. And it's a little bit of cacophony, they're
all tuning and doing their things. And then at some point the conductor gets up there
and stands there. It just stands there, sometimes with a little stick, you know. It just stands
there. And then you feel, you see the orchestra, it all gets quiet. Or I've heard of kindergarten
teachers when there's a cacophony of chaos in the kindergarten class. Some teachers will
stand in the middle of the kindergarten class and start whispering something. And pretty
soon all the kids quiet down. They yell, is it be quiet? That doesn't help. It doesn't
work. But there's something about the whispering that gets their attention. What's that? It
must be something interesting. And they all quiet down. So one way of dealing with a cacophony
is just to show up and be quiet. And this lends itself to the kind of language of showing
up and be allowing, showing up and being accepting. Don't fight what's going on, don't hold onto
what's going on, don't try to manipulate it. Just show up and be very present in this
accepting manner. And that approach of showing up and being very accepting, I think one of
the reasons why it's so popular here in the West is a lot of people who have been influenced
by Western culture, by American culture, have been traumatized by that culture in some degree.
And their sense of self, their sense of lack of self-worth, their self-esteem, their sense
of confusion about themselves is so strong that the beginning point in order to get anywhere
is practicing self-acceptance, self-compassion. Because if you do anything else, it just seems
to be just going to add salt to that wound of, I'm not good enough or I'm terrible or
I'm a bad person or something. And so we have to learn just to relax from all these beliefs
we have about ourselves. So it's often a very useful medicine for people here in the West.
So sometimes, you know, the conductor just gets up there and just stands there and that
works really well. It's also very aligned with the idea of mindfulness, because mindfulness
is just, you show up and you just pay attention to what's going on. That's all. Show up and
pay attention. However, the ability to show up and pay attention, maybe it's the conductor.
But there's still all these different facets of the human being, their mind, their emotional
being, their physical being. And you could just kind of let them all slowly harmonize
or quiet down with the conductor's presence. Or you can also engage them and use them so
they can actually start playing nice music together. After all, you don't want to just
to go to a concert and be content with the silence. The conductor comes up and stands
there and everything quiets down. It's very quiet. But that's not what you came to hear.
You came actually to hear the music, something beautiful being created. Some people, when
they practice meditation, are in so much need of destressing that they focus primarily on
the calming factors of meditation, getting calm, getting relaxed, getting quiet, which
is very nice. But again, it's nice. But it's less like the conductor getting the orchestra
to be quiet, so that's ready to do something beautiful. So when you manage to get yourself
somewhat calm in meditation, then you're ready for something else. And it's a pity not to
actually make that beautiful thing happen. So sometimes the conductor has to actually
go into the orchestra pit and actually work with some of these different players. So if
your body is wildly out of harmony with your ability to sit and meditate and be quiet,
maybe you actually need to do something with your body to get it prepared for meditation.
Maybe you need to exercise more or eat better or do something. Maybe it's not wildly out
of harmony, but maybe it's just a little bit. So you have to kind of spend some time being
patient and working with the body so the body settles down. There's a little bit of development
of a yogic body when you sit and meditate. You develop, your body actually kind of changes
if you spend a lot of time meditating. The shoulders begin relaxing, the chest kind of
aligns itself better, the vertebrae, the muscles begin changing and shifting. Because it's
kind of like a yogic posture you're finding your way into. And so it takes a while to
do that. And sometimes it can take months or even years to really kind of let the body
mold itself so it feels really comfortable and easy sitting in this way. So sometimes
we have to work with that. And then there's our emotional body. Sometimes our emotional
state is so wildly out of harmony with meditating that sometimes we have to do something about
our emotional state, our emotional experience. And sometimes we do things like we go and
have to do therapy. Or we have to actually address particular issues in some kind of
very powerful way. We take a class on depression or anger management or something. And so we
have to go and do something about that. We can't expect that meditation is going to take
care of everything. Sometimes it's not so wildly out of harmony. Sometimes just a little
bit out of harmony so we have to learn how to work with our emotional state. We have
to learn to work with it in such a way that we can harmonize it or make it so the emotional
state, emotional being is something that supports the possibility of meditating. And the idea
that our emotional state is something we can shift and make into a situation where it shifts
so it harmonizes with our purpose of meditating isn't going to be a little bit foreign to
many, so there's a lot of people. But there are emotional states we want to cultivate
because they're helpful. One of them is to be a little bit happy or joyful or grateful
or appreciative or inspired. Part of the emotional state of being is a quality of confidence
and faith. And so you actually cultivate confidence or cultivate inspiration or faith. And many
times when people in traditional Buddhist countries, before someone meditates, they'll
do some faith inspiring activity like they'll bow to an altar or do some chanting or make
an offering of flowers to the Buddha or something, do something, read a text, do something that
kind of gets that shift, we can shift in their emotional state, their emotional tone so that
they can, the emotional state is a little bit more in harmony with what they want to
do. Or perhaps what it requires is actually to look at, spend some time looking at what's
really going on emotionally. So you sit down with your anger and you have to really enter
into the world of anger for a little bit with mindfulness so you really understand it and
learn how to settle it in some deep way rather than just letting it be there in the background
kind of influencing what's going on. Or perhaps it involves having some wisdom, some understanding
about your emotional state and then some wise understanding of how to be present for it,
how to include it so it doesn't kind of trip you over as you work. And then there's looking
at our beliefs, really understanding what our beliefs, being sensitive that we have a
lot of beliefs that might be coming into play that have a bearing on how the meditation
unfolds. And so clarifying what those beliefs I think is very helpful and perhaps cultivating
beliefs, understandings, views that are actually supportive and helpful for the process of
getting engaged in what we're doing. So you'll know when the orchestra is in tune and when
the orchestra is beginning to play all the same music because you'll start feeling something
beautiful. You'll start feeling something really nice. You'll feel certainly calm at
ease. You'll feel some sense of joy or delight, sense of well-being, welling up. And if you
follow that and develop your meditation more and more, at some point what gets developed
is what's traditionally called powers, born or gets cultivated. And powers might also
be called forces, forces within us. So confidence becomes a force or power. I like the word
force here because it's actually something that's kind of wells up, it's very strong
and it's helping you, channeling you in the direction you want to go. There's also a power
called energy or effort. And at some point you don't have to make something. Effort isn't
something you have to make. Effort isn't something, but effort is something which has a power
of itself. Your effort, your ability to have energy is not in disharmony with your meditation
but is coming to harmony with your meditation and it actually becomes a force that carries
you. And it's no longer manual labor to meditate, but it's kind of like you're riding a wave
of energy that's kind of carrying you along. Mindfulness becomes a force where you don't
have to want to be mindful, you don't have to try to be mindful, but mindfulness is coursing
through. Mindfulness is what's happening and it's happening through you, with you. Another
force that's talked about in the tradition is that of concentration. So concentration
is not something you have to willfully make happen, but the mind is a force of concentration
going on. You can feel yourself being carried by that force, being engaged. And then another
force that gets born is the force of discernment, of wisdom. Wisdom or discernment becomes a
power that we have. And there's this tremendous clarity to really begin understanding what's
going on, really seeing, insight begins happening. You don't even get a sense, it's not even
you doing it, but it's just a force. It's a force of discernment, force of understanding
of wisdom that seems to be operating and coming into play.
So here with the language of power, as one of the things that gets born through meditation
practice, you see, again, where I started to talk about the sense of personal mastery
or power that seems to be in the traditional tradition. I think part of the strength of
this analogy of being the conductor of an orchestra is that even if you can't get the
orchestra out to obey, to listen to you or to quiet down, your job is still to be the
conductor who stands there in the middle of the pit, or stands there in the little stand,
and is composed and calm and unreactive, not caught, not frazzled by what's going on in
the orchestra pit. So your job is to find that place, the state of where you can be
somehow at ease, independent of, non-reactive to, all the different orchestras are going
on within you, to find that still point, find that quiet place, rather than being caught
and reactive to all the different things going on. And that's a huge training, huge undertaking
to learn to do that, how to sit in the middle of your life as it is with some composure and
dignity, and not be tripped up by all the feelings, emotions, thoughts, memories, experiences
in the world, projections of the future, you know, all the different things goes on, how
to learn to be a conductor in the middle of it. And as you learn to be that conductor,
to have that stability, then you also begin to learn how to begin trying to harmonize all
the different players that are involved in this ecosystem we call the human mind.
As someone develops the path in Buddhism, a description of such a person becomes luminous.
They radiate like the moon in the night sky. Isn't that great?
So as a background for this teaching of not self, there is this task of taming the mind
or developing mastery over the mind, training the mind, much the same way you would train
a really orchestra. And perhaps, you know, you have to push the analogy a little bit
further and realize that when you become the conductor, you don't get trained musicians.
You get all these, you know, at least half the orchestra is made up of kids who have
never picked up an instrument before in their life. So it takes a while to teach them how
to play music and instruments. But it takes a while. You have to be patient. And patience
is one of those members of the orchestra that has to become really strong. You have to develop
really strong patience so everything else can happen.
So those are my thoughts. And I hope that's interesting and useful. And for those of you
who are going to come the next Monday or two, please keep this in mind when I start talking
about not self. So you don't interpret what I say to mean that you're supposed to become
some kind of self-effacing, invisible blob as you become more and more a not self person.
Okay? Thank you.
