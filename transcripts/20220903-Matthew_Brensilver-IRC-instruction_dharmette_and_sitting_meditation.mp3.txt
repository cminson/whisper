 Yeah, so welcome. Welcome to all of you. I know many of you by name or face, those I don't know, happy to have you also. And my name is Matthew and teach here at IRC. And I'm one of many volunteers to supporting IRC, different ways. And yeah, so the cultivation of wisdom, I gave it a title, like a very sedate kind of understated title, because I thought that, you know, it was a quiet day or something. And I thought that was sort of in line with the kind of vibe of IRC and cultivation of wisdom, you know, and then I looked to see what Gil did, you know, earlier this summer, and his title was, I think, Darmic Pleasure and Karmic Beauty. And like, okay, that's a good, that's a good title. You got sneak attack from Franz Dahl on that one. And anyway, but hopefully the day will be rich in silence and we will be exploring the theme of wisdom and but it mostly be quiet practice together. I'm happy about and so I'll say say a few things and we'll guide us in and we'll just sort of move into the rhythm of our practice today. And as you see from the schedule break at 1245 Pacific time and and then yeah, finish, finish with, you know, have some questions in the afternoon. Dharma talk close at 4.30. So wisdom. We tend to think that wisdom is about talking, but it's more about listening. And our, maybe we say our habits talk and our wisdom listens. And the habit, the habit of talking, talking to ourselves about ourselves, to ourselves about experience, we kind of can't help ourselves in a way. We are compulsively trying to integrate each new moment into our autobiography. That sense of like we have to update, update the text with each new moment and to let go of that narration entails a kind of certain kind of vulnerability of porousness. Maybe we even say a lack of safety. And so we rely, we rely deeply on everything we've ever known in order to integrate and tie in this new moment. And so we just keep adding these little mini chapters to our autobiography moment by moment, but it's so determined by what we've always known and believed and been committed to. And it seems like there's no, no real other way to stay safe and to get what we want other than to really leverage our past in order to integrate the present. And so we use everything we've known, but everything we've known often includes a lot of delusion and wisdom is doing something new. Wisdom is doing something new. We're gathering, gathering data, we're gathering data. We cannot talk over the world. We cannot talk over experience. We, we're training and listening and the kind of receptivity and sensitivity of being very patient with our sense of conclusions, being very open to what is happening and not to try to keep the same narrative arc of everything that's come before, not to try to integrate each new moment into what we've always known, into all the familiar stories. And so we listen, we listen, we listen to our body and its circuits, especially the circuits around feeling, around affect. We just listen. Ajahn Sajita said that which we don't listen to, we become the, the anger, for example, that we don't listen to. We become it. We incarnate as it. We listen. And when there's that, when there's mindfulness, there's another degree of freedom. It's not just the anger or whatever it may be. And so we listen, we listen to suffering and to ease. We're sensitive, receptive, awake to our clinging. We sense the arising of faith, of a kind of heart movement towards Dhamma. And then we do this wholeheartedly. The listening is wholeheartedly. We know sometimes we're pretending, we're pretending to listen, but we're kind of just waiting to talk. We know those moments in conversation, right? It's like, okay, I'm being patient. I'm just, I'm not going to blurt this out, but I cannot wait till it's my turn. And then we're not really listening, you know? We're surrendering to, to not knowing, to not knowing. We're kind of relaxing the sense of, of, yeah, the narrative arc that we've been building all along. And then integrating this moment into that. And so there's this deep honoring, this kind of mindfulness is about knowing and not knowing. And at the interpersonal level, sometimes we, we look into the eyes of someone we care about and we can ask like, who are you really? You know? That's a beautiful question to ask about another person. And of course we ask it of ourself too. And so we're, we're, we're just relaxing some of the habit of imposing all the familiar old frameworks, everything we've written up till now onto this moment. And we're relaxing our sense of, of confidence, overconfidence about what we think we know, what we think we know. A researcher here, here at Berkeley said something like overconfidence is the mother of all psychological biases. And we feel so familiar and kind of entitled to our views about everything. But in a way, meditation is the recognition that we've been over, we're overconfident about, about the, the story of self, about what we think we want, of who will be in the next moment, of what we think we need and want. And so we're, we're kind of imposing all the karmic momentum of the past on this moment, but wisdom is doing something new. Wisdom is doing something new. We relax it all. And listen, listen, listen, very unsure what we'll hear. And we're listening not for the threat and opportunity that is the North Star of our ordinary life, but we're this thing for Dhamma. Now, one might get the sense of like, this is somehow, this completely, this sense of wisdom being something new, or we're completely groundless, or, but it's, we're not lost in the woods. There is this kind of trust, faith. Maybe we say trust in awareness. The trust that the more deeply we look, the more reason there will be to love. There is that trust. And so we're not unsupported, but we are open, very open, undefended to this moment. As we begin to relax all the familiar frameworks with which we integrate each moment, even the very simple assumptions of this is who I am. This is what meditation is. This is what I want. This is pleasant. This is unpleasant. This is good. This is bad. This is progress. This is a regress. This is plateau. We relax all of it. So let's sit together. Taking a few breaths in a way that helps you land.. you we relaxed whatever can be relaxed or bracing maybe hold certain pains slightly at bay but also bracing freezes our wisdom so we relaxed whatever can be relaxed air around the eyes and the jaw shoulders and the belly so we relaxed or braced thena you you relax whatever can be relaxed but if any intention remains we permit it to remain you you the sense of settling in And so of mindfulness making our inner life more safe.... So instead, perhaps you're safe enough to relax this narrative tendency of integrating this moment into the story that we're familiar with. We often have a kind of visual impression and outline of our body. Suddenly we're often nursing the story self of where I've been, what I'm doing now, where I'm going. Always doing something new. Relax all of this. We're ourselves up to the moment. I feel the Apo I feel the Luke deadline up at the front of me. Force it to keep you in the sherala. Open the Again. It begins here. You will feel what I'm doing. Not knowing is most intimate than it just says. After this video, please subscribe... you you you you you you you you you you you you you Who knows What you're supposed to learn. Diligence, diligence, we keep offering ourself up to the moment. It's not listening, but not intent and hearing and anything particular. Not needing to sort out everything pleasant, from everything unpleasant. Not needing to make something of ourselves, make something of this meditation. Not trying to engineer the Dharma, but offer ourselves up to it. Trusting in this gesture of awareness. You You You You You You You You So right now, in this last couple of minutes of sitting, I might have the tendency to narrate this moment to freeze you into the participants, meditators, me, into the teacher. I'll need to say something where I can relax back the intimacy of not knowing. Trusting whatever words bubble out, the silence, more useful than adding a new chapter to my story of self. You You You You You You You You You You You You You You You some anchor of attention with the walking, to be conscious of the sensations and the feet, for example, lifting, moving, placing. But I would also emphasize a kind of sense of the freshness of the visual field that each moment of seeing, it feels like we're looking at the world, and that's right in some way, I'm not disputing the reality of the world, but each moment of seeing is a novel moment of perception. And when I even move my eyes from this part of the screen to this part, everything changes, it's new. It's new, and so we're aware, we're aware that we're seeing and aware in each moment that something is different. So we'll have a period now away from the screen, and yeah, we'll come back half past, and that's it, and keep going. So enjoy the time with yourself, yeah? Okay, see you in a little bit.
