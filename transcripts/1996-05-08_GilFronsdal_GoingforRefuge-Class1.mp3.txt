 I don't know what to expect. So welcome to our refuge class. The inspiration for this, I think as I told some of you, is that I have a lot of respect and appreciation and some awe for the amount of commitment that many people in our Sangha have exhibited to the practice and to the Sangha and to themselves in participating so much. Some people have been coming for maybe longer than I have to this Sangha. For years people come pretty regularly, many of you come very regularly on Mondays for a long time. And it represents that regular commitment represents I think a, I suspect a very deep commitment for a lot of people that you wouldn't be doing this unless this had some real significance in your life. It's pretty demanding our lives. To spend one evening every week I think is, and some of you do more, represents a lot of commitment or interest. And I know for myself in my own practice and my own practice life that it was very useful to have certain rituals or ceremonies or activities that I did that kind of represented or solidified or acknowledged the commitment that I had towards practice and the inspiration that I had for practice. And some of those were formal, formal going for refuge ceremony, taking the precept ceremony. And some of them were things I kind of dreamt up myself or made into a ritual. The second time I went to Asia, I took a practice in Southeast Asia, I took the, for me I took a plane trip across the Pacific as being a rite of passage or a ritual of renunciation. And what I was renouncing was my, or attempting to announce, was my kind of egotistical sense of self that I was trying to kind of hold on to and relate everything to that self-concept. And I was really tired of it. And I felt like I needed some kind of ritual or some kind of rite that would somehow symbolize for me that this was, I was renouncing that part of myself. And so I took that trip, my second trip to Asia to practice in Asia, plane trip, as being that thanks to Korean Airlines. And so I thought it would be nice, not nice, but I thought it would actually be useful for us and for you to have such a ceremony, to acknowledge what's already true for you. Not so much to create anything or add anything for you, but I feel that there's enough commitment and seriousness and serious orientation that you've established for your life. But somehow acknowledge that not only privately for yourself, but in a ritual way, which often has a bigger deep impact in our deep kind of subconscious or unconscious or emotional places of our life, in a way that just listening to kind of some rational talk about Buddhism doesn't really touch. And also to do it publicly among your fellow Sangha members also can have that deeper impact of the meaning of it. So I thought of, so that was the inspiration then to have this ceremony then, which will have June 1st in the evening somewhere or other. I haven't given much thought at all where it might be. I thought I'd wait until see how many of you came to see where, you know, what makes sense. But the idea is to hopefully in June it's good warm weather. We can maybe do it outside or combination of inside or outside. June 1st is a full moon, traditional time for Buddhists to gather together and take refuge and take the precepts anyway. And we'll do an evening of maybe we can have a potluck dinner together and then do a sitting together. And then I could give a short Dharma talk and then we can have a ceremony with chanting and various things which we'll do kind of traditional things. But where we're going to do that, I don't know. So if any of you have any ideas, seeing how many people are here and where it might work, one possibility is to ask Jack Botanica to use his backyard. We've used it for chanting before and I think he'd be a lot delighted. And I think it's big enough. Or if any of you have any ideas. And then as preparation for going for refuge, I thought of having these four classes as a way for all of us to think more deeply, reflect more deeply about what it means to go for refuge and take the precepts so that it has a little more value, a little bit more conscious intention goes into doing that ceremony rather than just showing up after busy Saturday and sitting yourself down. There's a month long kind of reflection on it and thinking about it and participation with a fellow Sangha around these issues. And then coming together with that amount of intention has much more power I think for all of us. And what it means to go for refuge, I prefer to see as being something intensely personal, very personal. And I don't really see that I'm here to kind of tell you what it means to go for refuge. I mean I'll tell you some ideas and traditional ideas. But that's not really the point. The point is really to the ceremony is really to acknowledge something which you've made your own. And each of us probably has little or very different understanding of what it means to go for refuge, what the Buddha means for you, what the Dharma, what the Sangha, and what the practice is and what the precepts are. And I respect each of your understandings and each of yours orientation if you have. Anybody who comes as regularly as many of you have done inspires me. So I mostly wanted to find some way of channeling and acknowledging for yourself what's already true for you. Not so much add anything to you already on top of that. Going for refuge is considered to be usually the mark. Not the mark, but it's very difficult to decide who's a Buddhist in the Buddhist world. But the common kind of criteria it's often you find, many people refer to, is those who have gone for refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha is what, who is a Buddhist. And aside from that kind of common denominator, common commonality that many Buddhists share, there's a lot of different theologies and beliefs and practices and teachings that we might not share with each other with other Buddhists. But all Buddhists share those three things, taking refuge in Buddha, Dharma, and the Sangha. And so it's usually considered kind of becoming a Buddhist if you do it kind of in a formal way. But you don't have to do that if you don't want to. There's two understandings traditionally in the Theravāda tradition of what it means to go for refuge. One of them, and these are two Pali terms which you don't have to learn, but one of them is lokīya and the other is lokātāra. And lokīya usually is translated as worldly, but I prefer the translation of maybe customary or conventional, the customary understanding of going for refuge. And that's usually where maybe you become a Buddhist, you know, you're Buddhist. Or you take refuge in the Buddha and you take historical Buddha as an exemplar of a possibility for potential of someone who has attained something. The lokātāra understanding, which I kind of prefer the translation of the transformational understanding, so the customary and the transformational. And the customary just belongs to kind of the religious conventions and customs. You know, all kinds of different religions had different customs and cultural customs and religious customs and ceremonies and understandings. And some people who grew up in Buddhist countries just kind of take them on almost for granted without thinking about them very deeply because they're so customary to their cultures. The transformational understanding of the refuges is that you're not, it's not that you're a Buddhist, but rather it's a fact of being a Buddhist. In a sense, I think wonderful sense they say sometimes in Christianity, the difference between, you know, I'm a Christ, you know, so-and-so is a Christian and so-and-so is being Christian. There is a certain characteristics and qualities that a Buddha has. And if we have, if we discover those qualities for ourselves and those understandings for ourselves and live from that, then we're being a Buddhist, being rather than, you know, rather than, I don't know what to do with the verbs here. Yeah, maybe doing rather than being. There's a wonderful story, a famous story now in the Vipassana world of some woman who came, who had done, I guess, many Vipassana retreats and came and told one of the teachers that when she went home, she had a problematic relationship, I guess, with her family. She said when she goes home to her family, when she tries to be a Buddhist, when she's a Buddhist at home, it's a disaster. But when she's a Buddha, then everybody gets along really well. So there's this, you know, the customary and there's the transformational. And I think most of us relate probably a little bit, both of them are wonderful, I deeply respect both approaches, and they're not so separate from each other, they're kind of overlap. But I think for most of us here, it's a transformational understanding that really speaks to us, that there are qualities of awakening, of compassion, of mindfulness, of generosity, that of peace or calm or safety or something that we get from the practice of Buddhism. And those are the qualities of a Buddha. And we've started recognizing them in ourselves. And taking refuge in the Buddha, transformational point of view, is taking refuge in those qualities and those potential that we have, they might not be present always. And that's part of the reason why we take refuge, is to kind of re inspire them or to water the seeds of those potential, those qualities. And that's true with many different things in Buddhism, that there's a kind of a customary point of view of understanding them, and there's a transformational. And that's true for the precepts, it's true for going for refuge, it's true for the acts of generosity, it's true for, you name it I think. And the transformational is when it's a quality that comes out of you, and there's no, it's not really a dualistic relationship that's happening between you, the doer of something, and the object of the doing, rather it kind of arises out of you in a kind of natural open way. I like very much the image of an open hand. And the clinging is really the source of suffering for us. And I think a closed fist is kind of a great source of not only suffering for ourselves, but can do potentially a lot of harm in the world. And what the closed fist does, it covers up the soft tender part of our palm, which is really a delightful piece of tenderness and a wonderful way of being in touch with the world, through the fingertips and the palm. And the open hand then is not dangerous. The open hand is usually in Buddhism, the open hand, I think, is it pointing down? Yeah, I think the open hand of the Buddha pointing down is, and does anybody remember the symbolism? I think it's the offer of peacefulness, of fearlessness. And there's the open hand that's up, you know? There's open hand up, which maybe that, I think this is fearlessness. And I think this is, I have to look it up, I'll tell you next week, but the open hand. And again, the open hand is this place of vulnerability, of tenderness, that intimacy can happen and arise out of. And the same thing, I think, we can talk about an open heart and an open mind. And I think that what we discover is this open mind and this open heart and this open bodiness, where tender qualities of being, which often get squashed when there's a lot of clinging, a lot of holding, begin recognizing them, appreciating them and wanting somehow to make them more part of our lives. And one way I understand going for refuge is it's a conscious choice for people to reorient their life according to the values that they're discovering through their practice. It's pretty easy, I don't know, maybe I shouldn't say easy, it's hard enough. But it's one thing to understand some of the possibilities of an open heart and open mind in formal practice sitting on retreats. But it's a whole other thing to want to bring those qualities into our normal life and everyday life. And so taking refuge and taking the precepts is a way of beginning to wanting to try to reorient our life according to deeper values of what we feel is ultimately the greatest good. And then the wonderful story that I told on Monday of putting the begging bowl in the water and the Buddha's bowl going up current, going against popular currents. And so often reorientation is something that we need support in. And having a sangha and having rituals of commitment can be a great help. None of you need to become Buddhists by doing this. When I marry people, I'll only do Buddhist weddings, but I'm willing to kind of drop pretty much most of the Buddhist vocabulary. So kind of Buddhism is kind of camouflaged. But the elements that I want in a Buddhist for a wedding that I'll do is there has to be something some going for refuge as part of the wedding and going for refuge. And what they can either do the formal Buddhist refuges or what they can do is know what the Buddhist refuge are and then come up with some rewording that's really their own making, what they can take refuge in. And what I explain at the time of preparing for the wedding is that marriage is something, my understanding of marriage is it's something that happens between two people, but also in a larger context, that marriage should occur in a larger context, something larger that holds it besides the wishes and desires and the love that two people might feel. And that larger context can vary depending who they are, the people. But for a Buddhist wedding then traditionally it'd be the practice itself. Somehow you're holding it in the larger context of refuge in something beyond just your personal self, your individual egotistical self. And then what that means is up to each person to figure out. Take refuge in the Buddha, take refuge not in the personal small sense of self, but perhaps in the wider sense of an open-heartedness that is not necessarily identified with a small sense of self. And I do the same thing with the precepts where I ask people to kind of reflect on the Buddhist precepts and come up with their own wording for that also. So I want to say what I've already said is that this is really a ceremony that we're doing for you and not for Buddhism and not for me. And you come, we'll use the traditional words, but how you interpret and understand that for yourself is really something that is only, it's something you reflect on and make for yourself. The Pali words, we're going for refuge, Buddha, Saranam, Gachami. Saranam means refuge and Gachami literally means to go. And I like it a lot because it's kind of an active verb, to go. I take refuge is, I guess it's active enough, but somehow it's like you're appropriating something rather than to go for refuge, to walk for refuge, literally to walk, Gachami. To walk for refuge, to go for refuge is actually to move forward in a motivated way, in a conscious way in order to move into some new orientation that you have for yourself. And I think that's a very important part of going for refuge is it's an intentional act. Nyanaponika, a famous writer, distinguishes between three levels or three aspects to our humanity. He says there's the intentional, there's the understanding level, the cognitive level, and there's the emotional level. And going for refuge has all those three aspects to it. There's the intentional aspect, which you actually choose to do something, to actually enter into this new orientation to kind of find its meaning for yourself and have it resonate, see how it resonates and corresponds with something which is true for you. And then take refuge in that quality, those senses. So there's an intentional part. And then there's the part of understanding. It's said in the ancient commentaries about what it means to go for refuge, that the word Gachami for going for refuge means the same thing as to understand or to realize. So to understand the Buddha or to realize the Buddha also is one of the meanings for taking refuge in the Buddha. So there's an understanding part. And understanding has many different meanings, or to realize. And then the third is the emotional. And for me, my faith in Buddhism or in the Buddha or in awakening or in the practice is, sometimes I feel it's out of bounds or something. I probably don't see it that often because I don't often express it, but I have a tremendous amount of faith. I'm kind of wallowing in faith and kind of devotion. And I think the bottom, the ultimate thing that I have faith in or devotion to is the practice itself. And then some of the things that are associated with that, and there's many things with the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha. And there is that aspect, I think, of going for refuge, and it's also an emotional event. It's something which is heartfelt. It's an act of devotion or act of faith, of inspiration. It's an expression of confidence, of perhaps of love. Hopefully it's an experience and an act of joy also, that there's actually great joy in discovering these qualities for ourselves and taking refuge in them. It's said also that the refuges are protection, and they protect us. And to paraphrase Trungpa, he said he asked these protection cords that they have sometimes in Buddhism, he was asked what it protects you from. And he said it protects you from yourself. So the refuges are also a protection. And I think in a sense they're protection from suffering. And I think to understand Buddhism, understand refuge, to understand the precepts, also to understand the world of suffering, and to understand our individual participation in our own suffering. Not that all suffering is self-induced, but there is a big part of what we do in Buddhism is understanding our responsibility, our role, our participation in clinging and aversion and holding in gross and subtle ways that create suffering for ourselves. And to see the alternative to clinging, to holding, to aversion, to hate, and to see the alternative to that, and want to find some place to protect yourself from our tendencies we have within us, to be egotistical, to be full of hate or aversion or confusion. I think to want to find alternatives, to want to orient our life away from that is a very difficult thing that probably most of you have realized. And going for refuge, refuge is a protection in a sense from those qualities within us. So my ritual going across the Pacific was, in my attempt to kind of more fully acknowledge this reorientation from what I thought was an unhealthy way to live for myself. So that's some of the traditional understandings of what it means to go for refuge. And part of it, the ceremony is also taking the five precepts. And we'll have a chance to talk about that some. I'm actually, I feel actually really inspired that so many of you would come. And that you share enough, we share enough inspiration and faith and all that to want to come here on a Wednesday afternoon and do this. So it's really wonderful for me to feel this. And maybe our shared faith can resonate with each other. So do you have any questions or any comments at this point? Anything you want to bring up? Yeah. Probably not now, but if it's simple, you can ask a question. Yeah. That's beautiful. So that will discuss that during this class, the question of killing and what it means and interpretations and things like that. But these things are tremendously flexible to interpretation. So it's really a personal thing you're doing. So from your point of view, how can you say these precepts that have meaning and value for you that involve some kind of commitment? And so maybe it applies to a certain area of your life and not other areas. And that's fine. That's a fine way to do it. I thought also it would be good. There's so many of us, but still, I would like to just go around the room and everyone just say their name so that all the names can be in the collective. This is for first and current. Barbara? Dave? Cheryl? Is that everyone? Michael? Elizabeth? Gloria? Francis? Steve? Elena? Jim? Great. And I also thought that it would be nice and maybe important even for everyone to have a chance for some discussion about what all this means. And it's a large group to have a group discussion and everybody's going to have a chance. So I thought we could break into groups of three and just have a conversation amongst yourselves about why you came to this class and the idea of refuge and why you're interested in doing it and what it might mean for you. Some people find such things, some aspects of this to be intensely personal and I want to share the most personal sides of it. You don't have to then. You can do the less personal sides of it, whatever you're comfortable in saying. But yeah, so is that enough of a kind of instruction, what to talk about? I'm sure you have lots to say. So why don't you form little groups of three and why don't you just form the groups first in silence and then I'll start telling you when to start. Yeah, why don't you join someone? No. So what I'm going to do is, it is going to be somewhat casual, but it's important that everybody has a chance. So about every four minutes I'm going to ring the bell and somehow that's supposed to give you some, and we'll do this for about 12 minutes. So that'll give you some sense of, you know, make sure that everybody has a chance to speak. Okay. So has anyone moved to say anything about what that was like to have that conversation? Or did anybody hear a different perspective that was kind of novel or give you a new idea or inspire you or anything when you heard it from your friends? The best thing I heard in our discussion group was someone saying, as they explained why they wanted to take refuge, that until they said it they didn't really know why they were doing it. Until they really had chances to speak and the words came out. And I thought that was good because I mean that is sort of how it felt for me to, until I sort of spoke it was something that was inside. I didn't know what I was going to say. Sometimes some things only become real when they're spoken or only come into existence when they're spoken. All right. Thank you. Just speaking with two other people here, kind of like an act of refuge and sun. Can you say more about that? How so? I don't know if I can say anything about it, the feeling. It's just an open-heartedness that I felt. I also felt it Monday night, two weeks ago when we were asked to pair off with someone and there's that instant fear, oh I don't want to do that. And I've done the point where I can say, okay, that's there. So let's do it. So in doing it there's so much to offer and people hear because it seems sort of like a safe place. Perhaps I could speak to the same issue. I find it interesting that always expecting difference to find commonality is very enriching. It does feel like refuge to find similarities rather than differences. Yeah, I actually expect a lot of similarities even though I said everybody might be different. Maybe it's just for me an act of faith rather than anything you could know for sure perhaps, but I think at the heart the experience of awakening is the same for everyone. I think it has to be that way. And some of the qualities that come out of that then something we can all recognize together. And when I meet someone who I feel like something in them resonates with something I know within myself, it's really a delight. I can't really give a much thought to why I was coming to this class and getting together in group really made me stop and think about it more. But my experience with Buddhism is that I've been increasing my understanding of myself and others and being able to connect with others on a better level. And I just feel like there's a continual unfolding going on. And I don't know what's around the corner, but I just I feel like it's made a tremendous difference in my life and I have to sometimes laugh about it because I was raised in a very fundamentalist Christian background and I wasn't coming for the religion. I was coming to learn how to meditate and how to reduce stress. And I really feel like it has helped me just open my heart more and more. Beautiful. Thank you. One of the sentiments that I have often in relationship to practice or coming out of practice is an experience or a sense of gratitude. And often the sense of gratitude doesn't really have an object sometimes, just a sense of gratitude. And one of the things that when I bit at Buddhist centers where there was some chanting after the sitting, for me the chanting and the bowing that happened was a way to give expression to that gratitude. And that if I hadn't had those ritual forms of expression, I wouldn't have obviously had nice ways to give forth, give voice to those sentiments and feelings within me. And I think that's part of the value of ritual, of refuge, of Sangha perhaps, is to give an avenue for expression for things which in our normal life maybe wouldn't get expressed at all. And so gratitude, for me going for refuge has a quality for me personally of also great gratitude. And just gratitude in general, but also it's very easy then to feel gratitude. Maybe this is the customary understanding of refuge maybe. But then the gratitude towards the Buddha, gratitude towards the Sangha and the Dharma, actually in quite a literal sense, not in the kind of more personal sense I talked about before and the transformational understanding. So anything else that anybody wants to say? I think that's very similar. It's scary for me because, and that's what's scary for me about Sangha, because within a Sangha or that connection is the pull to a grief, to feel connected. And for me much more important is the pull to honor everything about myself and everything about the other person, whether I feel the connection, whether I feel that way or not, or agree enough. And so, you know, it's like whenever somebody starts talking with them and that starts happening, I can just feel this part of me that wants to say this and then it's scary to say it. You know, which is, I don't know, you know, I mean I wanted to be a place where I could not feel the same way as somebody else. I wanted to be a place where I can have other stuff and other needs, disagree and I can bet that people see my connectedness to them through that and that I feel they are. I think it's very beautifully said. And there is always a danger when you have any group of people together, especially around religion, to conform and to agree and to have shadow sides, things that are not considered proper to talk about. The famous one, the most famous one, Buddhists is anger. Buddhists aren't supposed to be angry, so you better not show your anger around the Buddhists. And so that can be quite dangerous to do that kind of attitude. What I would hope that we have in common as a Sangha, kind of, you know, I hear even interpretation, there's different interpretations, but what we have in common is a practice itself. And the practice means that you're never going to close your heart to anybody. And so it's a safe place even to act out, it's a safe place to be angry, a safe place to disagree with people. Even if you disagree with people, this is a community of people who are not going to turn their back on you. Or they're going to practice not doing that, they're trying not to do it. There's a commitment to doing that. We don't know what we're going to do, right? But practice is a practice, it's not necessarily, you know, we decide to be saints. But the practice involves a commitment. And the commitment, I think, is to stay open to everyone and not to turn away from anybody because they seem different or it's uncomfortable or something. And so more than that, I mean, both, hopefully both are true. Hopefully it's a place where we do feel some commonality or and a place where our individuality stands out. I did feel connected talking, but I just say the thing. The fear. And I'm okay with that. I just want to come. Yeah, I love it. No, I love it. I love it. I don't need to be taken. Yeah, so good. So now we have two people who kind of raised issues that make it difficult. And I think that's really great. So it actually makes it much more real. So, you know, you're all invited or encouraged. Buddhism is supposed to challenge you. If it doesn't challenge you, then it's probably not doing you much good. And to be challenged is to have, you know, not always, but it's important phases of your practice to have questions or uncertainties and doubts and things like that. And so to give voice to them, just like someone said to give voice to why they were here, you know, you discover something with you didn't know before, but to give voice to some of the reasons you don't want to be here, give voice to some of the reservations one has or hesitations or criticisms one has also allows for kind of deeper clarification to happen that wouldn't happen if you just kept it quiet to yourself. And I really hope this is a safe place for us also to disagree and all that and be different from each other. So given that, any other comments? Or is it too close to six o'clock, seven o'clock to open the floodgates? That's kind of what you said, and that's the fear of participating in the saga. And my own personal take on that is, or at least part of it, is when you get into this deeply, you become very vulnerable. And so I have this feeling of vulnerability, and you can wander around in the world and frequently find your vulnerable side pretty well trashed and stepped back. So it's an interesting experience to just kind of put your vulnerability out there. And in the saga, well, you know, am I going to get stepped on or not? So that's kind of my own variation of the fear participating in the saga. It's an interesting challenge. It's stepped on in a nice way. So next week when we meet, we can talk a little bit about taking refuge in Buddha. And maybe, you know, each of the three days we can be Buddha next week and then following the Dharma and the Sangha. And then we'll weave through that also a discussion of the precepts. And I think actually probably the precepts will be more lively, much more of a challenge. And we could spend actually the rest of the year on the precepts. But one of the things you might reflect on in this week as you go as preparation for the next class is just reflect on what this word or this idea of a Buddha means for you and what are the qualities that you identify with the Buddha. And if you think about qualities that you think that a Buddha has, this is the important part of the exercise, see if you can notice those qualities in the people you meet during the week or notice them in yourself. So that notion of Buddha is not so removed or separate from just people that you meet on friends and family and neighbors and strangers. See if you can notice that in people, whatever those qualities are that you revere or honor or are inspired by in this idea of a Buddha. And also, I trust that all of you know the precepts. If you don't know the precepts, you can let me know and I'll write them out for you. And so you might look at them each day. You might write them out for yourself. And at the beginning or the end of your daily sitting, you can just read them or recite them or something as a way of just making them part of your day. So there's a little more reflection than normal about these precepts and what they might mean for your life. Does that seem okay? Yes. Could you write out the chant? For next week I'll write it out and I'll pass them out so those who don't know, can read along. With the translation? Yeah. Anything else? Just when you think of if there's anything that we're going to be reciting on the first of June, if we could see that. Probably so you can learn it, right? Or so that you know what you're getting into. Yeah, it's a nice request and mostly it'll be the basic chance we all know already. There won't be anything really new or different. So that's maybe enough for today. Thank you all.
