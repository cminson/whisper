Dharmette: Simplicity as a Teacher  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

In our tradition, a n important teacher  for us is simplicity . 
The Theravāda tradition , which we are part of , and the 
insight tradition particularl y, are characterized  by a lot of 
simplicity: simple lifestyle, simple way of being , not a lot 
of reli gious paraphernalia or  ritual . And there’s often an 
appreciation tha t simplicity is a very effective and 
powerful teacher .  
 
It teaches us when we are not simple . We can  easily get 
complicated about things: ourselves, our relationships 
with others, our relationship to spiritual practice  – many 
things . In meditation practice , it’s possible to get all 
worked up about w hat you  are su pposed to do , and 
what is supposed to happen. I t can get  complicated . If 
you try to hold all the meditation instructions  together at 
the same time  – trying to do them, and find your way 
through them  – you’ll probably get a headache .  
 
So, k eep simplicity in mind , and then notice when things 
are not simple . Who’s responsible for that lack of 
simplicity? Is there a lack of simplicity externally?  
Maybe there is . It can be a complicated world , but a re 
we complicated in how we relate to it? Can we be simple in the midst o f all the difficulty?  
 
You’re not necessarily  always supposed to be simple . 
But you can use simplicity as a standard , or reference 
point , to help  you understand yourself, to put a qu estion 
mark next to how you are, what you are doing, and w hat 
you are trying to do . 
 
I believe that t his is p articularly valuable  in meditation 
practice . For most people , meditation practice unfolds 
best when it’s kept really simple . One way it’s not kept 
simple is by being goal-orientated  – trying to make 
something happen , or having expectations about what 
it’s supposed to look like, what you are supposed to 
accomplish, how you are supposed to fix what’s going 
on, how to get rid of things . One of the simplest ways of 
practicing meditation is just to offer your simple 
presence , simple attention to what’s happening .  
 
It’s remarkable how much healthy unfolding  – leading to 
a healthier life – can emerge out of the simplicity of just 
being present for our experience.  When we tr y to control 
our experience, push it away, try to fix it, or improve  it, 
sometimes we can  succeed . But when we succeed , 
there’s a way in which this can put an overlay on top of 
the natural unfolding of our experience . It’s quite 
something to settle back  and be present . It requires a l ot 
of presence  – simple presence . Then watch what 
unfolds as a consequence. W atch the unfolding, almost  as a natural w ay in which things change .  
 
Sometimes , when we are trying to change things, they  
don’t change . If you are tense , and you tensely try to 
stop being tense, you might actually get more tense . 
One way  to get un -tense is not to be worked up about it,  
not to be bothered by your tension . Just be present , 
holding it there . Then in that presence , things can begin 
to unwind and relax .  
 
Part of the reason this works is that most of our 
problems , which we feel exper ientially in ourselves – as 
being upset , angry , frightened , or tense  – come about 
because of some  activity  we are doing : clinging, 
resisting, doing something. I t’s an antidote to simply b e 
present in an open -handed way, to watch and be very 
simp le, to offer our presence so that we are no longer 
actively interfering . Or, if we are doing something , we 
hold it in a simple way , and then it has a chance to 
relax, unfold, unwind, and do what it need s to do.  
 
Another way that simplicity can be a teaching is  that it 
can remind us of the question : “Why do I think this has 
to be as complicated as it is? ” In these kinds of  
situations , maybe you don’t ha ve to see them as 
complicated. M aybe you don’t have to approach them 
as if you need a degree in quantum physics in o rder to 
solve  interpersonal problems. M aybe it’s enough to offer 
simple presence.   
There’s a form of therapy called Family Systems 
Therapy . In Family Systems Therapy, if someone is 
designated as the “family problem ,” as the person  with 
the psychological p roblem, Family Systems Therapy 
doesn’t s ee that individual as the problem. It sees that 
something is off in th e family system, and the person 
with the so -called  psychological problem is like the 
canary in the mineshaft – the most sensitive  one, the 
weakest link in the particular system of the family  – not 
the one  who’s the problem . To see what needs to adjust 
and change , the family is looked at as a system . One 
axiom  of Family Systems Therapy is that if one person 
can practice non-reactive  awaren ess, it moves the 
whole system towards health . That is a nice teaching of 
simplicity . Many people think their families are 
complicated . Maybe they are, but there is something 
about non -reactive awareness – the simplicity of just 
being present  – that can he lp shift and change the 
family dynamic.   
 
I think it happe ns for ourselves as individua ls. It 
happens in the family . It often happens in a community 
we are part of.  I’ve been in large gatherings that were  
out of control, chaotic. I t was really clear that if one or 
two people stayed calm , alert and present,  that seems 
to settle everybody else down . This teaching of simple 
presence works on many different scales . 
 I would encourage you to t ake on  simplicity as one of 
your teachers – whatever simplicity means for you . See 
if there is some w ay that , by having simplicity as  a 
reference point, you  can be wiser and more 
understanding about what’s needed . My guess is that 
more often than not , you’ll discover that l ess is needed , 
rather  than more.  
 
That’s what I have for today. Thank you.
