Sitting like a Mountain

There i s an ancient metaphor of a mountain , quite solid 
and stable, which is not moved  by the wind that blows 
by it. And t here’s a way of meditating, sitting, practi cing, 
where we can be more like the mountain than like the 
leaves that are  pushed around by the wind. There are  
many  winds that blow through us when we sit . The 
practice is lear ning how to let the winds of thoughts, 
feelings , or emotions move freely , while at the same 
time having  an inner stability  – a solid, stable core  or 
presence  that can allow the se things to move through  
us, as if they were wind, while we reside or abide in this 
stability like a mountain.  
 
Many people are very influe nced by the winds of their 
mind  or their feelings , and so they’re like  the leaves that 
are pushed around, up and down , and this way and that 
way. Moods go up and down . Concerns and fears and 
all kinds of things are pushed around by the wind. So 
how is it to have this greater stability?  
 
One of the things that can be very helpful, especially for 
people who practice sitting meditation, is giving some 
care to y our posture  when you meditate, a nd having a posture that is stable  and upright – a posture that 
somehow expresses stability. Sometimes there’s talk in 
Buddhism about having a posture that expresses dign ity 
or stability, because the physical body, especially when 
seated cross -legged i s like a triangle, like a mountain. If 
you sit in a chair, you can also get stability, a strong 
sense of presenc e, provided that you don’t use the  chair 
too casually. You don’t use  it as a place to rest back  and 
be supported. There has to be something we  offer to the 
posture ourselves:  uprightness, presence. It might not 
be righ t away, but with time  the body  can feel a strong 
sense of refuge or  support  – a resource – something  
you can fall back on and that will hold you, and that 
creates  a strong sense of presence  that is not moved by 
the winds go ing through.  
 
It’s quite something to have a strong sense of presence 
that is stable and  larger  than any of the particular winds 
that might blow . It starts  by losing some of the interest, 
or preoccupation, or some of the tremendous authority 
that we invest  in the world  of thinkin g. And the winds 
begin  to abate. We realiz e there’s another game in 
town. There’s another place to abide. We don’t have to 
stay involved in thinking. There can be a lot of feelings 
and emotions that go through, and it’s beautiful to have 
them come through, but we can feel like those emotions 
and f eelings are not who we are. Closer to who we are 
is some stability or presence, that seems radiant, full, or 
compelling . And this  begins to lessen our attachment and clinging to all  the preoccupation s and  winds that 
arise . The winds can just be winds comin g through  – 
and we can be the mountain.  
 
So maybe today as you sit and  walk, you can give some 
attention to your posture , and see if your posture can 
provide you with stability. Postural stability can translate  
into becoming  more stable , concentrated and present.
