Good morning, Kim.
Good morning, everyone.
Good morning.
So, welcome to our third session on...
Give me the card, give it to me.
What is my grade?
Did you take it?
Give it to me.
We could mute.
Okay.
There we go.
So, we just wanted to start as we often do with a little bit of a catching up from the previous session.
If anyone has comments or questions about the suitas that we read or any of the material we've covered up to now or just really anything on the topic,
this would be a great time before we move forward with today's material.
And feel free to raise your blue hand or really you could just unmute if you feel comfortable doing that.
Hi, this is Laura.
Hi, I just want to thank all of you for this wonderful suita studies and I was very encouraged when you answered Chris's question that, you know, this is going to be an ongoing program for the coming year.
And the reason it's very personal to me because I, I inspire to be a by in the Dharma, and I'm going to start a two year meditation training program with Jack Kornfield and Tara Brock,
and they tend to be on more of the secular mindfulness spectrum.
So, I just thought, well, it's okay, maybe I would just like learning another language. And so, you know, so I'd be kind of bilingual I'm like deeply rooted in the Dharma but then there's all the other modern psychological terms and so who knows, you know,
maybe I can be a bridge or whatever but, you know, it's the Dharma that gives me the nourishment so thank you.
Thank you, Laura. That's very lovely to hear.
Yeah.
Other thoughts, questions, reflection.
Consequences of our homework assignment.
Breakout groups to be pretty amazing us moving through and speaking because as each person spoke.
Almost as if I was speaking it sort of captured a big mind kind of feeling within the sangha speaking to this point. And I've certainly felt that before but it was very strong in the past to break out group they have and I just wanted to offer that out I was like, Yeah, I need more of this,
especially in these times so anyway thank you very much for having this group.
Great. You know some of what I hear in these comments is a quality of equanimity in that equanimity is a quality that makes the mind bigger and allows it to hold all kinds of different things that are may seem at some level to be disparate but they're not really.
So, seems like you guys are absorbing the material. Mira.
Good morning and good afternoon, and maybe good evening.
I thought this was a good time to slip in.
Speaking of the family of the cloth.
But as it as a relatively experienced dire, I want to mention that dying a stained cloth is great. And not only that but that the, you know, kashaya, this word that has a lot of different meanings.
But it's a stain, and the Buddha's robes are referred to as kashaya and this color there's a color kashaya but the idea is taking an impure cloth that the ropes are made from dirty thing so it's again another angle on equanimity but I think I'm mentioning it because I feel like there's a potential
to the reading of the clean. It needs to be clean to begin with, to be died. That's a kind of idea of purity, which some people might feel like is a, well, you know, I'm, I'm that that some people might have a sense of self which is stained, and that that's okay to then enter the sea of the Dharma.
That's kind of from a place of purity.
Yeah.
I'll invite other comments from the other teachers but what comes to mind, as you say that is the suit that points out that the mind is naturally luminous and that all the defilements are visiting in some way and so they're, you know, they're always subject to appearing and disappearing at various
levels. Right. And, and we might also distinguish between purity as a single sort of state from a purification, which is an action verb, and purification is wonderful and purity I think is a little suspect.
Yeah. So, see if anyone else has any comments to that.
Okay.
Ram.
Good morning and thank you for this opportunity.
A comment and a question.
So I was reading the Sutta studies this are pretty powerful it takes quite a bit of time for me to contemplate and absorb. I would be very grateful if some thought in the teachings today can we win being cognizant of hindrances as a part of this practice that continues to be my blind part in my practice in many
cases, but in the practice of equanimity. I think Mira just mentioned about being aware of my own preconditions and biases and what it leads towards hindrances.
I couldn't reconcile fully in my preparation for this morning, those aspects, any comments that you can we win deeply appreciate that.
Okay, thank you. Yes, I think the, the being able to hold various things that are in the mind is a big part of strengthening our awareness. And as, you know, mindfulness develops.
And when we do it the stronger it gets and the stronger it gets the more we're able to hold things. I think it was kind of like a level, you know, like there's a level and then a wave that comes in that's down below the level of our the strength of our awareness is no problem we can
ride that out. But every now and then these things come that are higher than our strength of awareness and so then we just know okay we'll keep, we'll keep strengthening.
And one just thought it, it took me a minute or two to think about the, the white cloth.
You know it's funny, the purity or purification are are stressed, perhaps in our readings, but something that strikes me is the, how rare white cloth was at the time and I'm reminded of a verse of poetry.
It wasn't, it wasn't a different lifetime one of toil and blood, and black this was a virtue, the road was full of mud.
That's a phrase from the Nobel Nobel poet, Nobel laureate poet Bob Dylan.
But I think, I think the rarity of white cloth is something that at the time when in fact, not not just roads but mud was in mud and dust everywhere and dust and mud are referred to in the in the suit as frequently so anyway, just another
thought doesn't have to be just the purity of it but the rareness of it too.
Gosh, I see Natalie and Bonnie why don't we take just those two and and hopefully they can be somewhat brief.
So Natalie.
Thank you.
I wonder if you could say something about how we might read the simile of the deft butcher is something I really struggle with as a vegan and ethical vegan for 25 years I really found it difficult to think about thinking about the elements as a process of violence or butchering
or dissection.
And I wonder if more could be said about what's being got at there.
Okay, so I think you're referring to the elements as they're described in the Satipa Tanasuta.
So correct MN 10 where the image given is of the cow, put your at the crossroads. Yes, it's as if a deaf butcher or butchers apprentice where to kill a cow and sit at the crossroads with the meat cut into portions.
Yeah, thank you.
Well, I'll see if anyone else has a comment first among the teachers. I could respond but I've.
Okay, so the.
Yeah, this is a this is a vivid and powerful image. And I think it's maybe meant to be.
The, the practice of the elements goes toward the understanding of not self.
That is the aim of that practice it's seen in MN 10 and it's also seen actually an MN 62 the one where we that we were quoting related to the elements of make your meditation like the earth and so forth.
And just before that section that we tell it within class, the Buddha teaches his son Rahula about not identifying with the body because Rahula was a young, beautiful young man at that time very handsome probably.
And he had a little conceit about his appearance. And so the Buddha was helping him with that. And my sense is that these teachings, at least in this context of the elements are pointing us toward seeing our bodies more as just part of nature.
As the same elements as the earth as the water as the trees. So there is a sort of a, as you point to as an ethical vegan a sense of unity with nature.
And we're not something special and something.
We project to those same rules, shall we say and so I think this, I don't know that it has to do so much with butchery as with not seeing the body as something inherently special and me.
Does that help a little bit to point toward what it's aiming at I think it's. Yeah, to big big question and there's more to explore there but maybe that's what I can say now.
Bonnie fairly quickly. Thanks.
One of the last things you said at the last meeting was when one recognizes equanimity to lean into it. And I'm aware that that's a difficulty for me.
Not only recognizing it but actually allowing it to be and acknowledging that and leaning into it and I'm wondering if you might say a little more about that.
What if he was talking about the leaning in was that in that was David okay go for it.
You know, one way to answer that is actually to plunge into the next teaching, which falls to me.
But I think the, the, the idea that when, whenever things arise in the mind and there's, there are several students that talk about this explicitly that there's sort of a choice that we can notice that our thoughts tend to move toward greater freedom or, or maybe toward
greater tightness greater stress greater suffering, and that the subtle inclining of the mind we do toward freedom over and over again creates creates a pattern of response a habit of response that is is wholesome that snowballs
or builds on itself and that issues forth in, in skillful action. So I think, I think that's what I was getting at and this can have very subtle expression in the meditation practice.
And that in a way, if I can make this a transition to the, to the teaching the first teaching segment.
I can see my colleagues nodding. I think I'll do that and I'll just try to kind of keep pointing to that as, as we go forward.
So we wanted today, having discussed over the course of this week, the way that equanimity appears in the text as a capstone, both in the wisdom practices, and we'll show that slide again and share it.
In the Brahma Viharas, so too it appears in the further development of the meditation practice.
And this is particularly found in discussions of sort of the, the wise meditation practice described, for example, in the last three factors of the eight full path, where wise Samadhi, which results in a peer and clear form of equanimity
in a sense the capstone of the eight full path. That is, the last three factors in the eight full path wise effort wise, Sati wise mindfulness and wise Samadhi have this, have this same place.
And Samadhi is sometimes translated sometimes glossed as concentration. In fact, that's probably its most, most frequent translation. I, I, I leave it untranslated. I think that's becoming maybe more, more done.
I think there are certainly other translations that can point us in, in sort of useful directions, including collectedness of mind, as the mind settles in meditation and as to bring in this theme of inclining the mind or leaning in toward freedom or greater ease.
It tends to open, it tends to still, it tends to become collected. It tends to become unified in various ways.
These various depths or various states of mind that develop as the meditation deepens and stills are, are described in the text as falling into a progression of four or more states that take the name that John is jha and a.
And this is a description in the text that seems to capture a mode of experience and it's worth emphasizing that what comes first or came first.
It was the meditation meditative experience, and that it's then captured in words, chanted passed on orally and eventually committed to language.
So I like to, I think it's useful to be very free and open with what happens in the mind and the way we characterize what happens in it as it becomes more collected becomes more unified becomes more settled with time.
We can say that it falls into these four jhanic places or states or modes, but it doesn't necessarily have to and the transition in these many of which are very familiar to all of us here can have various different ways of appearing.
So, in our discussion today we're talking about something that are sometimes called the suit to john is that is the john is as described in the suit as of the polycanon and we'll take a look at one of the one such description the standard stock description in a way,
just a moment, but I'll give you a sense of what we see happening in these descriptions of the way that the mind sort of accesses these apparently natural and kind of innate capacities of mind to become very still very focused very collected
very, very much at ease, very clear, very, very, very ready to let go deeply.
And the basic progression that's described and it's interesting how frequently we turn to metaphors using water is a little bit like if you're at the ocean.
And you're kind of waiting in, not the Pacific, not Mavericks, you know, but maybe the Pacific at san simian Bay where you're kind of waiting in and you go down, and you're aware that you know whoops you've kind of fall down a little legend and you're a little deeper in.
You sort of naturally as you move out kind of find yourself deeper and more deeply immersed.
What they what's described is that in the first process of meditation very familiar to us we use a fair amount of effort in redirecting attention to here and now using the breath as an anchor in the here and now or another bodily function or the bodily more the body more broadly.
And then, as we move forward sometimes there can be quite an upwelling of bodily content and sometimes it sometimes can be a buzzing or a sense of pleasure sometimes felt at the fingertips or the lips where we have so many nerve endings, sometimes comfortable sometimes pleasant
sometimes accompanied by maybe a certain subtle restlessness.
That tends to ease off with time and emerging more strongly can be a sense of slower, maybe a glow of more mental contentment.
And again, nothing here that's probably unfamiliar to to you.
Even this contentment of mine can become very still to the point where equanimity arises in a very clear, very, very distilled or concentrated form.
So, there's a process by which certain aspects of mind that we're familiar with that we that we become aware of are left behind or become very still and equanimity emerges again sort of taking this capstone position.
And because time is short, and while I could go on and on that's a very sort of over, you know, sort of a general overview of what what happens the mind getting progressively still or leaving behind some of the effort in turning toward more allowing or more
turning toward in a very subtle way, so that the mind becomes increasingly clear and clear awake alert in a profound way.
But let's take a look at the at Majama Nakaya, 119. And as I go through this, and I'll have to do it fairly quickly. I think some of you may be familiar with this text I want to emphasize what's familiar in it, as well as a couple other things.
And I'll go through it very quickly. This is the suit that devoted to mindfulness of the body and it directly follows Majama Nakaya 118 mindfulness of the in and out breathing.
The Buddha staying in one of his familiar places and gives directions on how to establish mindfulness of the body.
And you will recognize these, you go to a place where it's quiet, you sit down cross legged you bring attention to here and now, and you begin to focus attention on the breath.
You bring attention to the whole body, maybe do a body scan.
You take your meditation into a walking practice, or do it when you're lying down.
You take the mindful awareness of your experience to all your activities, all your daily activities.
When I first read passages like this, I have to tell you I had this just spark of awareness. This is where these instructions come from that are so familiar that I hear all the time on every podcast I listen to or every talk I go to or every guided meditation.
They come from these texts, and there's so much more here. I've just kind of skimmed over that but they're so rich in the additional detail they provide and the possibilities they open up the invitations they make.
And then, and just a warning to my colleagues I'm going to go over by a couple minutes I can just see it.
Apologies in advance, and fair warning.
And then it talks about in meditation, a meditator, this is an audience of monastics of followers of the Buddha, that in the first sort of deepening of meditation, there's a place where the mind is constantly replacing attention rebalancing coming back to the present moment.
This is compared in this simile to a bathroom attendant, again a deft bathroom attendant, who makes in the way we would maybe need bread, a ball of soap.
And it talks about how in needing this ball of bath power it becomes soaked and saturated with the moisture with water spread inside and out but not so much moisture as any oozes out and in the same way.
So in this set in meditation, we enjoy the seclusion we provided ourselves, and we keep bringing attention back to the here and now in a way that suffuses the body with attention and with awareness.
We start to get these this familiar kind of what I want to say a ringing of a bell almost in the in the rhythm of it this too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.
As meditation becomes stiller this rapture that I talked about this sense of physical pleasure or a weakness can come to be very prominent.
And the comparison given here is like sitting in a spring in which, or a body of water that is fed only by a spring, and feeling this sort of delightful up well of energetic ease that steep stretches fills and spreads throughout the lake.
In the same way, the meditator steeps fills and spreads the body with this same rapture, and this too is how we develop mindfulness of the body.
As this fades away, there seems to be a glow referred to in this translation as bliss this sort of more mental contentment that can that can arise.
This too comes to drench steep fill and spread through the body.
And again, this is a now this this contentment is free of the previous sort of maybe more jangly or more energetic physical sensations.
The only given here is that this is like being a lotus in a pool of water thriving underwater, and from the tip to the root, we're drenched steep filled and soaked with the cool water of this refreshing pond.
There's no part of us that's not refreshed in this way.
This too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.
Finally, when the mind is very still very collected very brought to a place of groundedness.
And in this case, in this suit in this context grounded in the experience of the body.
We've let go of a concern with pleasure and pain maybe let go of a foreign against or a sense of preference.
Neither resisting things or proving things. What fills our experience is peer equanimity.
And this equanimity fills the fills fills the body spreads through the body with pure bright mind.
And similarly given for for equanimity is a meditator sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth, no part of the body that's not spread over with the white cloth.
And in the same way the meditator spreads their body through with peer bright line no part of the body not filled with this peer bright line.
The mind becomes still internally, it settles unifies and becomes immersed in somebody, and that too is how a mendicant develops mindfulness of the body.
And just in closing, point out that in this state of equanimity that develops in the deepening meditation practice.
There can be seen with great clear clarity, there can be the clear seeing that we associate with the, particularly with the insight tradition but with these practices derived from the ancient texts, and that we become practitioners become capable of realizing
anything that can be realized. In other words, not only do we see things clearly but that clear seeing that's that's made possible by the equanimity.
That can help us be more awake in the world.
To leave it there, much more could be said, but I'm going to pass it on to Diana to guide us in some meditation.
