So welcome to this beginning of a journey we'll take through the Buddha's teachings on the four foundations for mindfulness. 
The four ways of establishing awareness. 
And I'll use these words mostly synonymously, awareness and mindfulness. 
And if I don't, I'll try to indicate that. 
But this journey, and this is a very famous text attributed to the Buddha, that is the foundational text for the whole mindfulness movement that's spread across the world now. 
It's also the foundational text in the Theravada and Buddhist world for the Vipassana movement that arose over the last hundred and some years. 
In places like Burma and Sri Lanka and Thailand, where the Vipassana practice became very important. 
And then we trace ourselves to that lineage teaching insight meditation. 
So this book, this text is central to it all. 
It's an interpreted many different ways and different teachings, different practices of Vipassana, of insight or of mindfulness. 
We'll sometimes choose different parts of the text to emphasize that or to select that as the primary practice they do. 
Some people do just do the breathing. 
Some people just do the four elements, different parts of the body. 
Some people will do mostly the mind states and some people will do the mental processes. 
And then some like to do all of it. 
One approach is one that's comprehensive that even though the text doesn't say this, that it's pointing to the idea that we would be mindful of everything in its own, everything in its own due time, but that there's nothing outside the scope of what can be included in mindfulness practice. 
A 360 degree kind of awareness. 
And the way that the text is set up and the way I believe, or the way at least I interpret it, is that it involves a progression to deeper states, a progression to a deeper connectivity to oneself, and a going from the outer parts of ourselves to progressively to the deeper, more subjective aspects. 
Subjective in the sense of deeper, in the sense of the source from which we operate, from which we create the actions of mind, the activities of mind, that then spill out the way that we experience the rest of ourselves and the world around us. 
So the journey kind of inward, and I like to think of it as a journey home. 
Home being where we're free and liberated. 
The text opens up with a very dramatic kind of promise or statement. 
It says that there is a direct way for the purification of beings, overcoming of grief and lamentation, for the overcoming of pain and sorrow, for the realization of nipana, of freedom. 
In the city there's a direct way, and so one way of understanding this is that these four areas of practicing mindfulness are, if you want to dive right into a path to freedom and liberation, dive right into kind of an intimate connection to the present moment where we can find our freedom, this is the direct way. 
There's indirect ways which are valuable. 
There are ways which are foundational. 
The Buddha put living an ethical life as a foundation for this direct path. 
So if you jump into this direct path before we've laid the preparation for it, it can be harder. 
So the ethical foundation is that kind of put our ethical life, have it be peaceful, so we're not agitated or worried or scared or struggle with guilt for what we've done, remorse. 
But there's a kind of ease with our inner ethical life so that we can have an ease for entering into this direct path. 
And so there are these four foundations for doing this. 
And the word foundation is kind of an important word. 
Some people nowadays translate it as for establishments, ways of establishing. 
And they are the basis upon which awareness grows. 
The basis upon which awareness becomes clarified, becomes revealed, and becomes freed. 
And so to just be aware without a strong foundation, awareness probably will be scattered. 
It will be unstable and easily kind of disappear by the slightest ruffle in the environment or in the mind and we're caught up again. 
So we want to create a strong foundation and it needs a basis. 
And the four basis for it that the Buddha offers here is a careful kind of grounded attention to the body, a kind of grounded attention to what's called feelings, a grounded attention to mind states, and a grounded attention to the mental processes in the mind. 
I think back in September or so I went through each of these four. 
If you want you can go back and listen to those talks and see what, you know, a little bit of background or introduction to them. 
And for this series here it will be going through in a different way, going through more slowly through the text itself with the idea that text is a practice text. 
And we'll practice with what goes on here in the text and rather than just being a textual study. 
And in that regard I want to say that we say in English it's a text which is, you know, in my mind it's kind of a written body of work. 
And we're such a written culture we have been until the web and now maybe we're switching to become more oral again. 
But originally this text was not composed as a literary work but as an oral work. 
It was something that, because they had no writing at the time of the Buddha or they had it, but very few people used it, maybe accountants and things like that. 
We have no, in the time of the Buddha all the teachings were composed orally and then memorized and then transmitted from one generation to the next by passing on the memorization of it. 
And so when we read a text as a literary work, modern audiences will often look for something different than what people are looking for or listening for in an oral text. 
Repetition in a written text is boring and puts us to sleep sometimes or our attention wanders. 
Repetition in a chanted text and a recited text adds a kind of rhythm to the text, a momentum to the text that it evokes because people are participating in their recitation. 
It taps into the places of memory. 
It's like a song where going over the chorus, the refrain, is carried along in the wave and the familiarity and there's so much in our body that participates in a refrain of a song that we can do it hundreds of times and it's still just as engaging for us, whereas reading it out of our times won't be. 
So I want to give you a sense of the journey of this text and try to and that I think for the oral participant in the text would feel it. 
They'd feel a rhythm in the text, a rhythm, kind of a wave after wave after wave, kind of coming and surging and passing and movement into something through it and then to the other side of it where there's a piece, there's a kind of a freedom that's found and that rhythm goes again. 
And again, 13 times in the text. 
And I think that rhythm is giving the oral listener of the ancient, the chant people chanting it, a sense of participation in what's being talked about in the text. 
So there's a, the medium of the text itself is demonstrating or evoking in people what it's actually talked about in the text. 
One of the things that makes this text quite brilliant is this way in which it is, the very way it's organized is somehow allowing the oral listener or the chanter to be kind of experienced what's being said in certain kind of way, in an embodied way, in a full way. 
So what I've done is I have simplified the text so that maybe I can give you a sense of this repetition that goes on. 
And there's a few things, key words, what I kind of let you know before I read it so you kind of can feel it more. 
First is the word abiding, sometimes translated into English as dwelling. 
Abiding to abide is to live in a place kind of as if it's your home. 
Like you're just there, fully there. 
And this is a very important word, viharati, in the ancient texts to abide. 
And it's used in particular for abiding in wondrous and beneficial states of mind. 
And the other important word is observing. 
The word observing in the text is used, again, also for very deep states of meditation. 
It's kind of had this non-reactive awareness that sees but doesn't affect or isn't fixated or touching or manipulating experience. 
You're just sitting back and observing in a very spacious, open way. 
And so there are these four areas to abide observing, the body, the feelings, mental states, and the mind and mental processes. 
And so the text begins, there's a direct way for the realization of nibbana, and it ends observing in this way leads to liberation. 
And so between this is a direct way and this leads to liberation, there's this journey. 
And the surge and the repetition of the same phrase is very important part of, it may be the most important part, and it's this. 
Observing change, abiding, not clinging to anything. 
So you'll hear that's repeated now 13 times. 
There is a direct way for the realization of nibbana. 
Abiding observing the body, mindful of breathing, observing change in the body, abiding not clinging to anything, mindful of posture, observing change in the body, abiding not clinging to anything, mindful of bodily activity, observing change in the body, abiding not clinging to anything, mindful of parts of the body, observing change in the body, abiding not clinging to anything, mindful of the four physical elements, observing change in the body, abiding not clinging to anything, mindful of decaying corpses, observing change in the body, abiding not clinging to anything, abiding observing feelings, mindful of feelings, observing change in the feelings, abiding not clinging to anything, abiding observing the mind, mindful of mind, observing change in the mind, abiding not clinging to anything, abiding observing mental processes, mindful of hindrances, observing mental processes change, abiding not clinging to anything, mindful of the aggregates of clinging, observing mental processes change, abiding not clinging to anything, mindful of being knotted up with sense experience, observing mental processes change, abiding not clinging to anything, mindful of the constituents of awakening, observing mental processes change, abiding not clinging to anything, mindful of four insights, observing mental processes change, abiding not clinging to anything, observing in this way leads to liberation. 
So this kind of simple summation of the whole text gives special emphasis to the idea of abiding, observing, seeing change, and coming to a place of not clinging to anything. 
So going through the process of connecting to all these things, being mindful of all these things, and in doing so, opening up to the world of change in a particular way, so that it leads us to this place of non-clinging, which is basically synonymous with liberation and freedom. 
So that was a general introduction to this series we're going to do, and hopefully we'll practice with it during the 30-minute meditation, and then have some teachings around it each of these weekday days for the next few weeks. 
So thank you all very much.
