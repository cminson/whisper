 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Just beginning by inviting yourself to land here, to arrive, just to settle in with however it is for you right now. Just contacting this present moment experience, just in a really light and natural way. Just recognizing how the body is, recognizing how the mind and heart are, and inviting a sense of settling and relaxation. You can check in with the body and see if there are any areas of extra tension or holding. Just very lightly inviting, a softening, a settling. Knowing that many of the patterns that underlie the tension that appears in our bodies and minds are very deeply seated. We can't expect to be able to fully relax at will, but just inviting whatever level of settling and softening is available. Being very easy and gentle with any tension that remains. Remembering that this body and mind is a natural process. I'm not trying to create any experience, but actually just get to know, to become intimate with how it actually is. If you find it supportive to anchor the attention with the primary object, the breath or the body or sounds, see if you can receive that anchor in a relaxed and gentle way rather than trying to stay with in a forced or a tight way. If you're practicing in a more receptive and open approach, just recognizing moment to moment, whatever is obvious. What's obvious in experience right now? You'll notice that this is quickly changing. One moment a sight, one moment a thought, a memory, an idea, one moment a body sensation, an impulse. A judgment, a state of mind. Just receiving this natural changing flow of experience. Observing a naturalist, observing this human life unfolding right here, right now. How is this human life manifesting? Not looking for any particular experiences. Just open and curious to how it actually is. Just as a good friend might ask how you are and really mean it, really be interested. Whether you're feeling well or you're struggling, available and you're available and interested in how it actually is. Can we meet our experience in this way? What's actually happening right now? No need to find a word or a label for what's happening, but just this recognition of this experience right now. This is experience happening right now. Thank you. When we notice that the mind is at times caught in some struggle or reactivity with what's happening, rather than struggling against that and trying to make that stop, this practice invites us to simply just recognize that as natural activity of the mind. Thank you. What is happening now? So in our practice, we can be looking at experience or relating to experience through a particular lens without quite recognizing that lens or that relationship to experience. From time to time, it can be helpful to just drop in the question, what's the relationship to this experience? What's the lens through which this experience is being known? We may notice a lens of judgment or liking or not liking, wanting to kind of move it this way a little bit more pleasant, a little bit away from that pleasant. At times we may notice, oh, there's simplicity and ease in the knowing. It's just a natural part of our experience that this practice invites us to include, just to recognize, to become familiar with. Remembering that this process of body and mind is a process of nature arising according to causes and conditions arising lawfully. We're just trying to get to know and to understand this process of our moment to moment experience, rather than trying to make it turn out how we want or get rid of unpleasant, have it be only pleasant. We actually want to start to get to know and understand how our minds habitually relate to pleasant and unpleasant. So when we're actually observing reactivity, any pushing or holding on, this is where the path deepens. This is good news to be seeing, to be noticing this when it's happening. And when there are periods of the mind being relatively at ease and resting in a simple way in alignment with what's happening in experience, we can recognize and appreciate that. This will naturally lead to it growing, just as recognizing and seeing the reactive patterns with this wise attention naturally leads to it decreasing without us needing to try to make it stop. Just this simple, non-interfering, curious awareness. Receiving this changing flow of sensations and thoughts, mental activity, sight sounds. You may notice the constantly changing and shifting nature of our experience. You may notice the mind trying to find somewhere to land amongst all that change and just recognizing that the mind is trying to find somewhere to land. And there can be a settling back and just knowing the change itself. Thank you. Just recognizing the present moment experience. Thank you. Thank you. Inviting the mind to be simple in the knowing of experience. Nothing to do with or figure out even when the mind is entangled with complexity. You can just know that in a simple way. The mind is being complex, just a simple knowing of that. Just recognizing whatever is obvious moment to moment. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
