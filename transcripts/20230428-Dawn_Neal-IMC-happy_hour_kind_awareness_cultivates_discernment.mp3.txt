And just to offer a few reflections tonight on kind awareness.
This is a thoughts about how cultivating Meta and the other Brahma Viharas or immeasurables involves an allowing and discernment or can involve both of those things.
And that these cultivations of the heart qualities are not just beautiful in their own right.
They're beautiful intentions. They can be helpful in concentration and emotional healing, all kinds of ways.
They're also onward leading in practice, maturity and awakening.
And this kind of gets to a key kind of recognition, one that's been very helpful to me in my own practice, which is that how we relate to what arises,
how we relate to experience reality is core to meditation practice, to Dharma practice, to Buddhist development and to life.
And this how we relate to what arises being key is one of the insights that's available through the cultivations of the immeasurable Brahma Viharas.
We make this choice to incline the heart, to incline the attention, the mind towards kindness, compassion, altruistic joy, equanimity.
We make that choice and we do it through intention, maybe through phrases or words, visualization, perhaps imagined movement, all kinds of imaginative ways and through sitting in practice.
And all of this incubates, begins to gestate the emergence of a kind of kind or compassionate awareness that can become available as a reference point.
It's an inclination to friendliness or allowing towards whatever arises.
And that happens through the course of this intentional cultivation and perhaps you've noticed in your own heart and mind there might be subtle shifts.
When you're not doing these cultivations in how you show up, how the mind shows up, how we relate.
I remember the first time I really noticed this, I was cultivating compassion through a different practice than this one through chaplaincy practice.
And this was well over 10 years ago and had a meditation practice as well.
And I had left a shift at the hospital, I was a volunteer and was stopping by Trader Joe's and just was struck that everyone I looked at in the grocery store was being seen against a backdrop of compassion.
Having just heard all these moving stories from these people.
Everyone was being seen against the backdrop of compassion, like a spotlight was on them kind of.
And this can happen anywhere, it can work in other ways too, it can be like a certain kind of
sparkliness or effervescence like you may in the past perhaps have heard of or even done canoeing or rowing at night and seen phosphorescence where the ore hits the water.
All these little sparkles come off. Sometimes we only see the kindness in the mind when some object of our attention rubs up against our mind or heart or attention.
And like, oh, the black water was invisible until the ore hit these little phosphorescent beings.
The kindness or the compassion can be invisible until we experience it for someone, something.
And there's other flavors of course of the heart qualities this sense of non contention or non hostility towards experience can arise.
And of course there's threads of all of the Brahma vaharas the immeasurables in each other in meta and kindness there are threads of compassion in altruistic joy.
There are threads of meta.
Each one contains all of the others at least in a tiny measure with equanimity being the one that's in all.
So perhaps you'd notice this.
Or perhaps if they show up more as allies to kindness these other heart qualities appreciation gratitude generosity, like noticing one invites the friends to come along in a sense, right.
And what I'm kind of getting at tonight is starting to incline our minds however little it's working or however amazingly it seems to be working in any given moment.
It becomes even just the intention the intention to cultivate the kindness becomes a bit of a reference point.
And part of what happens then is there's a discernment and understanding or a seeing of everything that isn't that.
So contraction ill will anxiety defensiveness and patience.
All of those are not kindness, compassion, joy, equanimity, generosity.
And it's seeing these things are not a mistake, allowing the whole picture to be seen, the entire shirt scene starts to cultivate discernment wisdom.
It's possible to start seeing the unpleasantness of the opposites of kindness and its friend.
And our hearts and minds naturally begin to move in a more helpful direction.
This happens to your mindfulness practice as well.
The practices we do here at happy hour are a little bit more intentional.
And all of this discernment can happen with so much more power, if we can step back and include everything, everything in a field of loving non contention.
The pettiness, darkness, grief, whatever, all of it to be seen and loved and shifted.
There's a snippet of a haiku from Izumi Shikibu, Japanese poet.
I think she's around 14th century, I could be wrong.
She writes, watching the moon at dawn, solitary mid-sky, I knew myself completely.
No part left out.
So with that friends, let's settle back into practice.
I am going to temporarily remove the ability to unmute yourself, just to allow for silence in case someone brushes up against a setting accidentally or tiptoes into the moonlight.
I invite you to settle into a comfortable posture, balancing ease and alertness.
Allowing the eyes to soften, it feels right, allowing them to close.
First, just taking stock, noticing whatever is here.
Maybe energy that it took to get here or residue from earlier in the day, conversations or actions, work, whatever.
And just acknowledging it.
Offering the kindness of attention.
And then noticing this body, the weight of your body, the chair or cushion or surface.
The grounding through your feet or back or buttocks, whatever is touching.
However indirectly the earth beneath us.
And allowing the weight of your body to be received, held.
Safely in awareness.
It can be helpful to take a few slightly deeper, longer and more intentional breaths.
Allow any excess tension.
Out on the exhale.
And then attuning to the sensations in the body.
The aliveness, the warmth or cool, tingling, pulsing, contraction or spaciousness.
And inviting, inviting the intention, may this body relax.
Allowing softening if it wants to happen.
And allowing kindly, gently, whatever is present.
And then too, including the heart and mind in the field of awareness.
Noticing with as much graciousness as possible, whatever is happening there.
And inviting, may this mind relax, may the heart relax.
And attuning then to the whole felt sense of all of you.
With tip of your head to the toes in all directions.
All of your heart and mind.
And inviting your attention to settle, collect.
And the felt experience of breathing or sensation or hearing.
Just for a little while.
Allowing the heart to rest.
The mind to rest on each in-breath and out-breath.
Feature rising and passing.
Depreciating the empty spaces between, spaces between sound or breath or sensations.
Settling.
And then inviting in.
Attuning to the felt sense or image.
The thought of someone, some creature, being, person.
Naturally makes your heart smile.
Makes you joy, friendliness.
Attuning, offering, offering kindness, goodwill to them.
And perhaps receiving it from them.
Rememberably, it's like, great. Very simple.
Noticing how it feels to offer these good wishes.
Perhaps allowing a smile to come to your lips.
Or if it feels right, place a hand over your heart on another part of your body.
If it feels hopeful, to focus these wishes with words or phrases.
The invitation is to do so either perhaps some of the words I offer here, repeated in rhythm.
Or words of your own in your own language.
Silence is also fine.
Be safe, happy, healthy.
Be peaceful, easeful, free.
Thank you.
Repeating whatever words or internal gestures of offering.
Feel good to you, maybe like ripples or radiance or hand gesture.
Glowing rhythm felt.
Be safe, happy, healthy.
Be peaceful, easeful, free.
Be safe, happy, healthy.
If you haven't already, the invitation is to expand the wishes of loving kindness or compassion, joy, equanimity to yourself and this other one perhaps.
Imagining the two of you offering these wishes together to each other and outwards from you towards others that feel easy or that attract those wishes.
Be safe, happy, healthy.
Be safe, happy, healthy.
Be safe, happy, healthy.
Feeling any sensations rippling through your body.
Including this body, this heart.
In the wishes of kindness, goodwill.
Every cell, every muscle, every bone, every pore.
Be safe, happy, healthy.
Be peaceful, easeful, free.
Be safe, happy, healthy.
Be safe, happy, healthy.
Noticing and encouraging any feelings of warmth, love, kindness, any of the heart quality.
And if those heart qualities are not there, appreciating the beauty of the intention.
Be safe, happy, healthy, peaceful, easeful, free.
Be safe, happy, healthy.
Be safe, happy, healthy.
Now for the last third or so of this meditation.
You're welcome to continue in this way if this feels nourishing and good.
And the invitation is to draw intentional cultivation of images or words so that they may come.
And instead to tune into the quality, the quality of the feeling or awareness itself.
The mood, kindness, compassion, goodwill, joy or equanimity that arises.
A natural awareness of what is happening in the body, heart and mind of this moment.
Each arising, revealing a heart quality like phosphorescence is revealed in water by the oar.
Creating the intention to meet experience with kind awareness, whatever arises.
And if the meditation has momentum and that's what's arising, enjoy and allow that too.
Everything included in the field of kind awareness.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you for allowing and receiving.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Time to time reconnecting with the intention and the meditation, noticing sensations, emotions arising.
Kind awareness.
Allowing everything to be seen and emerge and to drop away again.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Reckling in from time to time with your body, your heart.
Allowing what is, is a form of kindness.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
The last moment or two of this meditation, tuning in to the intention or heart quality of kindness, compassion, joy, any of their friends.
Turning into that wish and appreciating the beauty of that aspiration.
May all beings be safe, happy, healthy, peaceful, useful and free.
May our practice here together be a cause and condition for the increase of these beautiful qualities in ourselves and in the world.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you for the sincerity of your practice.
Now as this has become the tradition when I teach happy hour, the invitation is if you're comfortable to turn on your video and to take a moment to offer a pulse of goodwill, kindness, friendliness to the others in this Zoom room.
Whether you're seeing or not seeing, trusting that you are also receiving good wishes from the others here.
Thank you.
