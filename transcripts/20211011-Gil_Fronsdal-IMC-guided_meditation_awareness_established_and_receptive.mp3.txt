 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Hello everyone, and nice to be back here with you. And I want to begin with an analogy that I've talked before, and it makes the point well. When my son was in preschool, so he was three and four years old, sometimes I'd visit the school, wonderful school, and wonderful teachers. It was fun to watch the kids running around chaotically in the various rooms of the preschool, and it certainly was chaos and a lot of joy watching them and also seeing the joy in them. And at some point it was time to change the schedule, to change what the kids were doing to get them ready for something else. And one of the teachers would stand in the middle of the classroom, and he would just stand there very still upright, and the kids were running around him and through his feet, there were all kinds of things they were doing, but he was just standing there. And then he would begin to whisper, talk very quietly. And it was remarkable to watch then all these little kids begin to kind of slow down, sit down, gather around him, until after a minute or two, all the kids were sitting quietly and had gathered together around the teacher, and then he would tell a story. And they probably knew that this was the deal, they recognized it, but this way of getting their attention was not a command, he was commanding them to shut up and come here. It was nothing like that, he was just standing attentive in the middle of it all and being quiet, and all the kids gathered around and got quiet themselves. So this is a nice analogy for meditation practice, that we are in a sense establishing ourselves with awareness at the middle. We're establishing the awareness we have, the attention we're going to use to be here, becomes established kind of at the center, center of our being, center of here where we're sitting, and all the ways that our thinking and our feelings and everything gets us scattered, spins us outwards, the outflow and the scatteredness, about thinking about the past, the future, fantasy, the way that feelings keep us activated, engaged in thinking and story making. Because we have awareness centered and established in the middle, it kind of works as a gathering point. Things start getting collected, it's kind of like there's a little bit of a gravitational force that without any more insistence than gravity may be in some ways, that begins, things begin pulling in, coming in, getting settled, gathered. And it's kind of a special thing that what we have to do is stay aware, stay present in the present moment. And then this gathering begins happening, this collecting of ourselves and all the desperate parts, the scattered parts, collect together. So we don't have to do so much the work of bringing the mind back. We don't have to do so much work of, you know, jerking the mind back or being disappointed in ourselves. All we have to do is to come back to being aware, be here. And I like the word just here for that, just here. But here, open and aware of what's here, present for what's here. And then things begin, you'll probably see that things will slowly begin to come closer and closer and there's less tendency to wander off or get involved in the scatteredness. That'll still happen, but just come back to here, to here. And perhaps to do that with a quietness within, not a forcefulness, not a, you know, insistence, not a expectation. Just like the way that a loving kindergarten teacher would stand there loving the kids, being quiet and being present and beginning to tell the story that gathers them together. So assuming a posture that allows you to establish mindfulness, establish awareness. Lowering your gaze, relaxing your eyes, not looking at anything in particular, loose focus. And then gently closing your eyes, that's comfortable for you. And taking a few long, slow, gentle breaths, imagining that as you breathe in, it's like you're spreading your arms wide to gather yourself, to gather all the scattered pieces. As you exhale, you bring it all in, close in, let it settle as you relax on the exhale. Breathing in deeply, a full embrace of all that you are. And the exhale, letting it all relax here back to the center. And then letting your breathing return to normal, and on the exhale, relaxing different parts of your body, with the idea that in relaxing, something is gathering, settling back into the place of awareness. Relaxing the face. As you exhale, softening the shoulders, and as you soften your shoulders, settling back into a place of awareness, being here, relaxing your belly, maybe almost as if you relax your belly and it settles, and there's a groundedness in here, a rootedness here. And then, centering yourself in your breathing, being here, not so much reaching out to the breath, to breathing, or directing yourself to the breathing, but more being aware, being present, being available for what's happening here and now. And more like allowing the breathing to find you, as if the sensations of breathing in your body are arriving in the awareness that knows your breathing. And when thoughts override your attention to breathing, reestablish the awareness, the knowing, that receives the inhales and the exhales, as if breathing is part of the gathering together. And over time, you'll notice that even the mind that begins to think will feel like it too is known, as if it arrives in awareness, and there's no need to wander off with the thoughts. Everything is arriving in awareness, supporting. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. And as part of welcoming the breathing into awareness, you can say the word in as you breathe in, maybe with the idea of welcoming it as it arrives. You can say how, as you breathe out, welcoming the sensations that come with the exhale. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. You might think of awareness as a place of rest. Where all things gather together to rest in the embrace of awareness. Allow things to arrive in this restful place of attention, knowing. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. Present moment awareness. And for the next three or four breaths, see if you can relax more deeply on the exhale. Maybe relaxing something deep in your core, deep inside that's agitated or tense, activated. Deep relaxation. And then as we come to the end of this sitting, there is a wonderful reversal that can happen with awareness. That if you do not direct your attention outward, if you don't direct your actively your concerns to outward into the world, but you allow yourself to be receptive. So the world arrives in awareness. It's kind of like you're settling back and just available for things to be known. And when you do that with others and we're not distracted or preoccupied with doing and directing and making and fixing and protecting, it's a deeply relaxed, receptive, available to receive the experience of others. It takes a room that allows for a deeper experience of love, of care, friendliness, goodwill. The more we are receptive to the world, the more room it allows for these positive dis-feelings for the world. And so at the end of this sitting, to allow the world to come back to you, of your community, your friends, your family, colleagues, neighbors, people in your neighborhood and out across the lands where you live, and to receive them, to know them, to be reminded of them with no obligation, nothing you have to do except to allow your heart to receive their presence. And perhaps with a relaxed heart, the heart then responds with warmth, tenderness, care, an orientation of being friendly. And to give voice to this warm feeling of care, friendliness, you can allow your heart to, in a sense, to say these words, May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. And may you, your heart, from your heart, from your inner life, may their flow naturally, easily, an inspiration to contribute to the welfare and happiness of all beings. May this generosity spread out from us, out into the world. May all beings be happy. Thank you.
