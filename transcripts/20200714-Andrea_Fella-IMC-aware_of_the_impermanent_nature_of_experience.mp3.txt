The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

As I was saying in the guided meditation to begin to establish mindfulness, to have a
continuity of attention, that takes just some simple awareness of what's happening moment
to moment.
But then as that gets established, we can start to notice the impermanent nature of
experience.
It does take the establishment of mindfulness, a continuity of mindfulness, over time to
begin to see experience arising and passing.
So in just a single moment of mindfulness, something is there or there's an experience.
But we're not so much able to see the changing nature of it until the mindfulness, there's
more continuity, more moments of mindfulness.
And so the exploration around impermanence becomes more possible when there's a little
bit more stability of mindfulness.
I will say, it's not really, it's not necessary to have a long stretch of continuity in order
to notice impermanence.
This can happen even in the space of like a second of mindfulness.
We can notice very deeply the impermanent nature of experience and have a very kind
of deep transformative understanding as mindfulness pops in for just a few seconds.
It does take kind of being attuned to the experience of mindfulness so that we can recognize
it when that happens and be attuned to what's happening rather than either jumping on what
we've become aware of when mindfulness returns or berating ourselves for not being mindful.
But just, oh, here I am.
This is what's happening.
In that kind of arising of mindfulness, there can be a continuity that sees this impermanent
nature of experience.
So as I mentioned earlier, I think before I started the recording, the refrain, this
aspect of the refrain taking in the impermanent nature of experience is a support for insight
and understanding.
Insight and understanding around what leads to suffering and what frees the mind from
suffering.
It's a specific kind of understanding that the Buddha is pointing us to in the teachings
of the Satipa Tana Sutta.
It's not wisdom around how to be a better partner.
It's wisdom around what leads to stress and suffering and what, in this system anyway,
I mean, the understanding that there is something that is, in terms of when we experience stress
or suffering, there's an aspect of that being created in our own minds.
And that while we can't necessarily change the external conditions, although the practice
of becoming mindful and aware of what's happening internally and externally can help us to navigate
and potentially support change in the world with less stress and suffering and reactivity
on our own parts, that we may or may not be able to affect change in the world.
But we don't have to be whipped around by what's happening in the world.
We can have a stability of ease and peace in the mind, not suffering, not having a constricted
heart around what's happening in the world or what's happening internally or externally.
And that takes quite a bit of wisdom and understanding to begin to let go of the habits of reactivity,
the habits of reactivity that kind of create that extra experience in our own selves that
is that tension, that tightness, that suffering that the Buddha says was possible to release.
So the exploration of impermanence is understood to be a part of how we can see and understand
the experience that's happening to support our minds from having reactivity around what
is happening.
So the impermanent nature of experiences, it's highlighted over and over, not just here
in the Satipa Tanasuta, but over and over in what the Buddha taught.
He encouraged us to notice the impermanent nature of experience, partly because a lot
of the stress and suffering that is created in our experience comes about because of a
misunderstanding that we have, that things are lasting and would be reliable as a place
for happiness.
There's a fundamental way that we misunderstand how we can be happy.
We rely on things.
We tend to habitually rely on things in our experience in the world as being somehow
stable that we can land there and say, yeah, if I have that, if I have that experience
and make that last, then that's where happiness will come.
And what the Buddha points out is that there's no experience that lasts long enough to qualify
for anything that's reliable.
And so he's pointing us to notice the nature of experience.
Instead of being deceived by the way our habits work and our minds work and the way we've
been taught that, yeah, get these things and that's what's going to make you happy, instead
of being deceived by that, to actually look at the nature of experience.
It's impermanent.
It's not reliable.
So all experience is impermanent.
It's actually so wildly impermanent, way more impermanent than we usually see in our ordinary
everyday experience.
I mean, as I sit here and I look around my room, I've got this couch sitting here and
this couch has been here for 27 years, 27, 22, something like that.
It's been here for a long time.
It's pretty stable.
It's here.
And that's the way our minds work.
I mean, it's like, I feel like I can rely on this couch being down, being here.
It's there.
It's there.
It's not that I have a lot of connection to happiness about the couch, but there's a way
in which the way our system habitually works, that it tends to impute this reliability of
this stability.
It's an illusion.
Some of that illusion, the impermanent nature of experience is revealed on many different
scales, let's say.
There's the cosmic scale of the planet and the universe, and this planet came into being,
I don't know how many, 13 billion, I can't remember, something years ago, 4 billion?
I think it was more than that, is it 4 billion?
So it didn't exist 5 billion years ago.
The universe is wildly changing on a universal level, the scale of change in the universe.
The planet is pretty new, and in the planet we know, based on the life cycle of stars,
this planet will eventually be consumed by fire when the sun dies, explodes, and becomes
a red giant.
It's going to supernova at some point, billions of years from now.
So even on that scale, we don't tend to think of the Earth as being impermanent, but the
Earth is impermanent.
And then there's the more ordinary, say, human scale of experience, that we can begin to
recognize over lifetimes, just seeing beings are born, beings die, we will die.
Our own lives are not permanent.
These reflections can help us to take in this fact of impermanence.
And then there's a more, you know, and then there's a more ordinary, kind of ordinary
daily kind of impermanence we can reflect on.
And you know, this is a great time to reflect on impermanence, because things are so wildly
different and seem, you know, each day, well, right now we may be coming into a kind of
what we have been calling a new normal.
And what new normal tends to mean is that we begin to count on things, you know, we begin
to count on this is the way it has been, this is the way it's going to be.
So the new normal is basically attributing a kind of maybe a temporary permanence.
We're hoping it's a temporary, a temporary state of this new normal.
But there is a change that we can witness in our day to day lives, you know.
And even as simple as the sun comes up, the sun goes down each day, the shadows move.
We have to eat because our food is digested and, you know, it's no longer there to nourish
our bodies.
We need to put more food in our bodies.
There's just millions of ways, you know, that impermanence shows up.
And yet we don't really take it in.
There's a deeper level of impermanence that's happening moment by moment, actually in our
experience level, the experience level, what's happening at our sense doors, which is what
we can experience.
That is changing moment to moment.
I mean, even my moving my eyes here like this, you know, it's like the way what's happening
there is that there's all these new like light waves hitting the eye.
There's nothing new, there's nothing stable in what's hitting the experience moment after
moment.
The sense of that stability that we experience is partly, you know, it's partly because of
the way our system works to stabilize experience so that when I move my head, it doesn't look
like the couch is jumping around.
It feels like I'm moving my head.
But what's coming into the visual field is a very jumpy kind of experience.
It's very dynamic.
It's very changing.
So there's this kind of very momentary level of impermanence as well.
As we attune to impermanence, as we kind of get curious about it in this, you know, reflecting
on the impermanent nature of experience at all these different levels is one way to begin
to to attune to impermanence, just kind of like letting that be a reflection.
How am I noticing change right now in every single moment change is available.
It's not like we have to like create some special conditions in order to see impermanence.
It is everywhere.
It is just not something we tend to attune to.
And so through a reflective practice, we can begin to attune to it.
We can begin to attune to the nature of experience as arising and passing, as coming and going.
As we attune to it in this way, part of the reason this is supportive or maybe the main
reason this is supportive for understanding and insight is that as we really deeply see
that whatever is being experienced is impermanent, our system begins to recognize or understand
that it doesn't make any sense to try to find happiness or to cling to something that is
changing, that that pattern or habit of looking for happiness in experience, looking for happiness
in what's happening in the world, trying to construct a reality that we will can stabilize
and be happy with, that that's a futile project and that tends to just keep us in this loop
of the clinging and craving.
So the seeing of impermanence, even at the level of reflection, begins to help our mind
to kind of let go of those tendencies to cling.
Another exploration that can be useful, aside from that reflective process, is one of the
instructions the Buddha offers around looking for happiness in experience, and we're going
to do that, it's not necessarily a bad thing that we do that, but the misunderstanding
or the misattribution that I will find a lasting happiness there, that is actually a stronger
tendency in us than we might think.
It's kind of embedded in that movement to get what we want.
And so the Buddha encourages us in a particular teaching when we start to see that we are
getting happiness, you know, getting happiness from getting something that we want.
He suggests, okay, that's fine, you notice that there's some gratification there from
getting something that you want.
Notice how long the gratification lasts.
So that again begins to point to, you know, it's like what the process around craving
and clinging is, because as soon as we see, you know, it's like we get something, and
as soon as we see the weakening of that gratification, what do our minds do?
It feels a little dissatisfied as that gratification starts to weaken, and we start looking for
something else to want, something else to find that hit of gratification.
And so this is the project that we're engaged in.
And the Buddha said that through the seeing of impermanence, we actually can find our
way not to a place of hopelessness and despair, but a different kind of happiness that isn't
reliant on landing on something and controlling it or maintaining it, that there is a happiness
that comes with kind of aligning ourselves with understanding the nature of experience
as impermanent.
The happiness of not clinging to things that are destined to fall apart.
It's a subtle kind of happiness, so perhaps not obvious how that would be happiness, but
your experience will let you know it's happiness.
When you see that the mind let go of wanting, of that clinging to something that it thinks
is going to make it find happiness, when it lets go of that, there's a different kind
of happiness there.
As the craving releases, the release from that, it's like being released from a vice
grip.
So there's a different kind of happiness the Buddha was pointing to.
Then there's another piece of the, just one last piece I want to bring in before, okay
I'll try to leave about 10 minutes or so for conversation, another piece of the wording
of the sutra, Bhikkhu Bodhi says, one abides contemplating the body and it's arising factors
or it's vanishing factors.
That language is a little strange, Bhikkhu Naliyo translates it a little different.
He uses the word the nature of arising and the nature of vanishing.
One abides observing in the body, it's nature of arising or one abides observing in the
body, it's nature of vanishing.
That to me has a little bit more, that translation has a little bit more kind of curiosity, it
sparks some things and what we've been talking about, I've been using the phrase noticing
the nature of experience to be impermanent.
This is a kind of a way of attending to experience and this is a, as the mindfulness gets continuous
we can actually start to see moment to moment that experience arises and passes away in
the breath.
A new breath arises and then the sensations change and the breath passes away.
The sensations themselves are rapidly changing.
And so the moment to moment mindfulness can begin to reveal the experience.
Body sensations, feelings, thoughts as arising and passing away.
We initially begin in the mindfulness by attuning to the qualities of the experience.
The sensations, the pushing, the pulling, the pressure, the tension, the fullness that happens
with the breath, the releasing, the relaxing, the settling that happens in the exhale.
The different qualities of the experience are attending to the experience itself.
And that's kind of how we begin the establishment of mindfulness so that there can be a continuity
of noticing moment to moment.
This is what the experience is.
As we, as the continuity begins to get stronger, we can start instead to kind of orient or shift
the perspective of how we're attending to experience from the qualities of the experience,
the pressure, the pulling, the tension, the tightness, the color, the form in this field
of sight, the, you know, the smells, the tastes in the, in the field of sound, in the field
of sound and taste, to the nature of the experience as arising and passing away.
So instead of being so kind of attuned to the specific qualities of the experience, we
get more interested in the general nature of the experience as impermanent.
But then there's another way that the, this phrase, the nature of arising strikes me.
And that is that, you know, to begin, to be curious about not just about the nature of
the experience, but the nature of some, that it is arising, the nature of the arising,
the nature of the passing, and the nature of arising and passing experience that we start
to notice again with the continuity as we can see experience unfolding over time.
The nature of that, those arisings and passings are not random.
They are conditioned.
We start to recognize that something arises, not just kind of out of the blue kind of,
but arises because other conditions have been present that support its arising.
And so this kind of contemplation of noticing the nature of arising may begin to, to have
us be curious a little bit about how does something begin to arise?
What are the conditions that lead to its arising?
This again in the, in the continuity of mindfulness, this can start to be revealed as we notice
experience moment to moment.
We start to see this is happening and then this thing happens and our minds understand
the connection between them and we understand the conditioning that's happening in that.
So this begins to help us so the, in a way, I've been exploring two of the three kinds
of wisdoms that are pointed to in the Buddha's understanding that supports our freedom from
stress and suffering, impermanence and unreliability.
So Anicha and Duka, I've been pointing to those already.
The third, the not self-nature of experience, that begins to be revealed as we attend to
the conditioned nature of experience.
Because we start to see that what we attribute or take to be I or me or mine is not a thing.
It's not a permanent kind of entity, but it is a conditioned process.
It itself is an impermanent, changing process, but the conditioned nature of it is what helps
us to see that, that truth, that understanding of the not self-nature of experience.
So the conditioned nature of experience also begins to be revealed as we explore the arising
and passing of experience.
So an example of the non-randomness, maybe we can see, for instance, as we see a feeling
arises about something.
We might begin to notice that a feeling is arising that's independent on a view or a
belief that we have.
This happens actually all the time.
I would say view is a leading cause, a feeling tone, belief.
What we believe is a leading cause about what we feel, about what we experience, about whether
it's pleasant or unpleasant.
So this happens in race relations, but I'll make a simple example here around a snake,
seeing a snake.
So if you see a coiled form in the corner and you think it's a snake, if you believe
that it's a snake, probably there's going to be an experience of unpleasantness of that
sight and there's going to be an action that follows.
Maybe fear will arise and there'll be an action to remove yourself from that place.
But then suppose that fear seems very natural, of course.
There's a snake there.
It's unpleasant.
And yet that unpleasantness is conditioned not on the snake itself, but on our belief
that it's a snake.
Now that may be hard to kind of take in, but just imagining the situation where you recognize
then that that coiled form in the corner is not a snake, but it's a rope, a misperception
of that experience.
With the misperception that it's a snake, the belief that it's a snake is born leading
to the experience of unpleasantness and fear.
With the revised perception that it's a rope, the experience is not unpleasant.
Unpleasantness does not arise.
And so the belief that it's a snake is conditioning the unpleasantness.
This is shot all through our experience.
And this is just one tiny example of the conditioned nature of our experience.
So I think that's most of what I wanted to share about this aspect.
There's a lot here to explore.
There's the kind of the reflective piece, the kind of just attuning to impermanence
and kind of like orienting to how am I noticing impermanence right now?
That's not the insight into impermanence.
But it helps to create the conditions for the mind to be available for the understanding,
the direct momentary, moment to moment understanding of impermanence to arise.
That understanding of the impermanent nature of experience and the conditioned nature of
experience leads to a real kind of reworking internally of what our system thinks is going
to lead to happiness and how it understands that the clinging to what it habitually thinks
is going to make us happy is leading to our own stress and suffering.
And as that is seen, the mind begins to let that go.
So the seeing of impermanence, direct seeing of impermanence is a direct condition for
the mind to let go, to let go of the ways in which it habitually clings and holds.
