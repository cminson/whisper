 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Connecting to how you are in this moment in a simple way, maybe just simply recognizing in the broadest terms, is there some agitation or is there ease? There can be a mix of both, but just acknowledging that, that side of your experience. Opening to the fullness of your being, arriving with yourself here and now. This process of arriving with ourselves is supported by relaxation. It can be helpful to consciously explore, relaxing the body, as a way into arriving. Awareness of the body and noticing if there might be able to be a little bit of softening or relaxation with the body. This is an amazing awareness of body and this inclination or invitation towards relaxation as a way to connect with awareness in the present moment. So you might just check in, noticing the bodily sensations, the sensations in the head and face and seeing if there can be a softening, an invitation to relax. Head to face. Checking in the sensations of the neck and shoulders and maybe to that area can soften, relax. Maybe the neck and shoulders can relax. Maybe the arms and the hands can relax. Taking the attention, taking the sensations in the area of your chest and upper back, the area around the rib cage, maybe that area too can soften and relax. Softening, exploring relaxation, the possibility of relaxation of the stomach and abdomen, the muscles across the stomach and abdomen, the middle and lower back, the hips, the legs and the feet. And too there might be a possibility of softening, exploring relaxation inside the body. Maybe the inside of the throat can relax. Maybe the heart, the area around the heart can soften and relax. Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax. It's deeply inside the body, allowing the organs, instead of being held in to the chest, to be supported by the structure of the body and the body supported by the earth. Our weight received by the earth. Perhaps too there might be the possibility of the mind softening, relaxing, letting go of mental tension or softening around worries or concerns. Maybe the mind can relax. Maybe continuing that exploration of an internal relaxation, as Gail sometimes offers, the brain can relax. And the exploration of relaxation in this way is using awareness to connect with body and mind. And to notice this possibility of relaxation of body and mind, to whatever extent it is available. We don't have to grade ourselves here or have some idea of how relaxed we should be or even whether relaxed at all. Can there be a connection with just a simple being aware of how you are? The exploration of relaxation may have created conditions that have changed the landscape of how you are in this moment, from where you were at the beginning of the sitting. So just noticing how you are receiving, receiving the body as it is. Whatever sensations are obvious, easily available. You don't have to direct the attention to choose some particular aspect of experience. You don't have to kind of settle and allow awareness to simply receive whatever is coming in as being known already. If we don't actively choose to direct the attention, attention will be with something. The attention may shift from one experience to another, the sound for a little while, body sensation for a little while, breath perhaps, a thought, a new motion perhaps. Sometimes the attention will connect with something that seems very clear to us, like the sound, a particular sound or a particular body sensation or the sensations of a breath. Sometimes the attention will connect with something not so clear, something more broad, more pervasive, maybe a sense of, in general, how you are, the broader sense of how you are, the broader sense of all that is happening. Is this experience of this being human? Sometimes it's not so clear at all what's happening, what attention is connecting with. And sometimes in those moments it can also be possible to simply recognize there's awareness. And I don't know what the experience is, but knowing that there is awareness. We don't have to consciously be able to name or recognize the experience that's happening. Now we can feel it. The awareness can feel it. The processes of our body and mind are designed to feel what's happening, whether or not we consciously recognize it, consciously can name it. This can take some trust because we so like to know, like to have identification for things, experiences. So can there be a little bit of trust in just the feeling side of the experience, whether feeling experience of body or feeling experience of mind? This whole process is supported by relaxation. Relax, inclining towards relaxation. Receive what attention is already aware of, already connecting with. And exploring the possibility of allowing and trusting, allowing the experience to be as it is, without resistance, without holding onto or pushing away. And if there is a noticing of resistance or holding on or pushing away, sometimes we can explore perhaps making the field a little bigger and just receiving that too. That is just another experience. There is experience happening and resistance is happening. Are you aware, allowing awareness to receive? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
