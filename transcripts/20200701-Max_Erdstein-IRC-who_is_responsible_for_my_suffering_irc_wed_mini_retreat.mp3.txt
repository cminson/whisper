Thank you for your practice, it was very nice to sit with you, even though in this YouTube format we're not able to see each other visually, we can't see you, I can feel you. 
This is a poem by William Stafford, some of you may be familiar with William Stafford. 
He, I first, I first became aware of him, I think it was on a PBS, this is many years ago, on a PBS special, I think it was Bill Moyers, there was a poetry series that he did on public television and Bill Moyers interviewed different poets, and this was even before I had encountered meditation practice, there was something about William Stafford that was like a kind of a spiritual guide or spiritual being. 
He famously said, so he was a pacifist and he was a poet of the Pacific Northwest, and he famously said that he wrote a poem every day, you know, part of his practice was to wake up very early in the morning, before am or something, and lay on his sofa and start writing, and then he was asked, what if, what if the words you're writing aren't particularly any good, that, you know, one day, and he said, oh, I just lower my standards. 
And I think there's something, maybe we could say similar to cultivating a regular meditation practice, once we've been sitting for a little while, no, we're not that concerned about one particular sitting in the experience of that sitting, sometimes will become, sometimes will be activated, agitated, sometimes the sitting will be pleasant and peaceful and blissful, and sometimes it will be painful, sometimes it will be challenging in all sorts of ways. 
But if we don't have some external standard, this is what it's supposed to be. 
We can remember that it's not about what we're experiencing in meditation, but it's about that we're willing to return, willing to look, willing to keep coming back. 
So I feel that's a little bit of what this poem is about. 
It's called, you reading this, be ready, if we could say you hearing this, be ready. 
Coming here, what do you want to remember, how sunlight creeps along a shining floor, what scent of old wood hovers, what softened sound from outside fills the air. 
Will you ever bring a better gift for the world than the breathing respect that you carry wherever you go right now? Are you waiting for time to show you some better thoughts? When you turn around, starting here, lift this new glimpse that you found. 
Carry into evening all that you want from this day. 
This interval you spent reading or hearing this, keep it for life. 
What can anyone give you greater than now, starting here, right in this room when you turn around? What can anyone give you greater than now, starting here, right in this room when you turn around? So I appreciate this invitation to turn around, to be ready, to appreciate what we have here here. 
We're usually, we're always looking, we're looking ahead, we're looking over there. 
And I think meditation practice is in some way holds up a mirror to ourselves, holds up a mirror to our heart, to our mind, to see what's there, to see what are the energies, what are the habits, what are the conditions that can be softened. 
So this idea of mindfulness as a readiness is one of the ways that sometimes mindfulness is characterized. 
And early in my practice, I remember hearing a teaching that was about mindfulness as ready, ready to do and ready to not do, ready to do and ready to not do, ready to act, ready to offer what's needed, and ready to just be, ready to rest, ready to receive. 
So in a way, I think about these as two sides of practice, and I think often in our teaching about meditation practice, we give a lot of emphasis to the receptive side, the kind of accepting, accepting things as they are, receiving, resting, being, and it's important. 
And I think the reason we emphasize this is because our conditioning is so much on the side of doing and fixing and improving, and, you know, so to offer this other, more receptive side as a balance, it makes a lot of sense to me, I appreciate that reminder. 
And I wanted to also offer that there is a side of practice or an element of practice that involves a tremendous amount of agency, of empowerment. 
I think one of the ways that we suffer, we can suffer, and certainly in times like these when there's a health pandemic, when there's political unrest, uncertainty, there can be feelings of disempowerment, or feelings of helplessness, you know, and this is one of the hallmarks of trauma, is that trauma is, and gender is a kind of helplessness. 
And so what I would like to suggest is that our Dharma practice, our mindfulness practice is one way of reclaiming agency, of reclaiming responsibility, one way of taking power in a way, of not being a victim to circumstances. 
I think maybe if we have not really encountered a practice like this, and we begin practicing, we may, maybe not so explicitly, but we may have the idea that, yes, there's suffering in my life, yes, I'm suffering, and maybe there's some small percentage of my suffering that has its source in me that I can kind of be responsible for, but there's a lot of suffering that I have that's caused by you, the world, other people, circumstances, right? And so what I would like to suggest is that as we practice more and more, as mindfulness practice, as Dharma practice deepens, as it matures, there's more and more of our own difficulties, of our own suffering that we're willing to take responsibility for, that we're willing to see, I can do something about this, I have some agency here. 
And so this piece of our suffering that we have agency over, that we take responsibility for, begins to grow and grow and grow, and this is radical, this is radical in saying that we have a lot more power over how we are, how we live, how we perceive our self, how we perceive our life. 
We have a lot more agency than we ever imagined. 
And so there's a way that we start to take more responsibility for our own hearts, our own mind. 
And in the word responsibility is this root of to respond, what is it to respond? And so we start to see that we have the capacity to respond, we have the capacity to meet all of what's here. 
And see that a lot of our suffering is dependent on us actually, on how we are and how we look. 
And this is not in any way to say that there isn't unfairness in the world, that there is an injustice, but it's actually reclaiming our own power, and it's reclaiming our own capacity to over our hearts and minds, that we're not victims, we're not at the mercy of circumstances. 
So that's I think the radical, the radical invitation and the radical promise of practice. 
So what does it mean to do this? When the world is a mess, you know, I come back to one of my Zen teachers primary instructions, which is to make your bed. 
How can making my bed have anything to do with the suffering that I have, the suffering of others, the suffering in the world? What I appreciate about this teaching is that it shifts the focus from something that's out there, that's amorphous, that's abstract, that's out of our control, to what's in our control, and our immediate environment, the small details of our life are something we can do something about. 
We have some agency over this, and there's an important part of practice which comes about when we begin to see that there are no small, meaningless details in our life. 
It's kind of like this insight that everything matters, everything is valuable. 
In the Japanese Zen tradition, I'm forgetting the Japanese phrase, it's translated as attention to the small details of life is the family way. 
I think it's easy, maybe especially among Westerners, to be so, you know, we're so captivated by our ideas, our great thoughts that we're thinking, and the way we divide up life, we divide up the world between what's important and what's not important, you know, who's the important, who are the important people, and who are the not important people, right? And this is a challenge of that, and it's the saying that part of the insight of practice comes from, it's almost like a vision of equality, we could say this is one of the qualities of equanimity, this balanced mind is the insight into the equality of things, that who we are, what the Dharma is, is expressed in the smallest things as well as in the biggest things. 
And we may not have control over the biggest things, but we can make a big impact in how we are, in how we care for our life, in all the little details, all the nooks and crannies, you know, we have this vision of practice as this great light that's allowed to kind of flow and touch and illuminate all of the hidden corners of our life, all of the hidden corners of our mind, and you know, so this is kind of like making your bed, and it's not because there's some super important eternal truth that's only expressed when you make our bed, but it's that we become the kind of person who takes care of the details, who does things that no one will ever see, no one will ever know. 
A lot of the things I love doing before I go to bed is just checking on my children in the room, and sometimes I'll, you know, if it's a cold night, I'll fix the blanket, right, you know, if the blanket's been kicked off, or maybe I'll straighten them out as they're about to fall over or something, and even if they open their eyes, and they kind of seems like they see me, the next day they don't remember it, they don't know, but it's this, you know, it's just, it's love, this kind of looking after them in this very small way, you know, this kind of hidden way. 
So what are the ways that for us we can, yeah, reclaim agency in our life, in our practice, and so this kind of teaching, this metaphor, literal and metaphoric of making our beds is one way, taking care of our immediate life, and then to see that when we have this idea of making our bed, our bed includes the whole world, our bed includes others, our bed includes our community, our neighborhood, our country, our world, includes our relationships, you know, so if practice is about looking at ourselves, you know, and taking more responsibility being able to respond more and more to our own difficulties, our own suffering, we don't just stop with the bed, you know, our literal bed, we don't just stop with it, it's important, it's important to have this sense of self-care, self-regulation in our immediate life. 
And then the more we open, the more we settle, the more awareness is allowed to meet everything that's all the nooks and crannies of our heart, our mind, more and more is included into this fear of concern, this field of concern, field of love, field of responsibility, one of the, oh I think I'm supposed to take questions now, if you have a question, you're invited to type it into the chat and I'll be able to see it, but one of the, one of the ways that, the kind of classical examples of how we can take more agency and more responsibility through our practice is through the letting go that comes from forgiveness, you know, it's often been remarked that to forgive is a kind of letting go and it's not about the other person or people or what has happened and it's not about saying that's fine, it's alright, it has, it's this inner, this inner release and this inner healing that can come when our heart is freed from the other, is freed from that, some old story, so it's just one example of taking agency for our own suffering, I'm going to take a look now, see what's, so I'm not seeing so many questions, nice to see, nice to see participants from Oregon, from Israel, from Washington, Michigan, San Francisco, wonderful, one of the great blessings of this format is that it's bringing us together, bringing us together, all these different places, so maybe I'm aware of the time and maybe I'll just conclude by sharing this poem again, this is William Stafford, you reading this, be ready, starting here, what do you want to remember, how sunlight creeps along a shining floor, what scent of old wood hovers, what softened sound from outside fills the air, will you ever bring a better gift for the world than the breathing respect that you carry wherever you go right now? Are you waiting for time to show you some better thoughts? When you turn around, starting here, lift this new glimpse that you found, carry into evening all that you want from this day, this interval you spent reading or hearing this, keep it for life, what can anyone give you greater than now, starting here, right in this room when you turn around, to be ready to turn around, to be here, I love this line, are you waiting for time to show you some better thoughts? Are we waiting for some better moment? How often have we been so willing to sacrifice this moment for some imagined better moment? There's a great story in the middle of an intensive meditation retreat, Suzuki Roshi talking into the silent meditation hall, everyone is sitting very still and most likely in some kind of physical and mental anguish in the middle of an intensive retreat and Suzuki Roshi says, it doesn't get better later, so if it doesn't get better later, maybe I can let go of those fantasies and return and be here fully and reclaim the power, the agency, the beauty that comes with responding in this moment, being awake in this moment. 
This is the moment, this is the moment that we can meet, this is the moment where we can be free.
