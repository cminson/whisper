The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So it's kind of funny that we're talking about the electronic buzz with recording here when I think sometimes buzz can also mean
excellent kind of hyperactivity.
So to become, to be peaceful.
So if a person is sitting in meditation and they are worried about the rain,
what are they going to wear with the rain? How are they going to be safe in the rain?
Isn't it going to be dangerous this rainstorm that's happening?
They have to go out in the rain.
And there's all this agitation and preoccupation and maybe fear and tightness,
contraction around thinking about the rain.
And so maybe that's easy enough to imagine something like that or another concern.
But then it turns out that not only is it not raining, there was no rain on the forecast.
The skies are clear.
And, you know, and so all that concern about the rain and I'm going to be safe in the rain and how I'm going to manage the rain.
You know, it had no real world reference point.
It had no, it didn't, it was kind of a imagination that it was raining out there.
And so the agitation and sitting in meditation thinking about the rain was all self-caused,
was all in this little universe of inside our skull and here and here and now.
And we were contributing.
We were creating a little rainstorm in our own minds.
And in doing so, we were creating kind of a lack of safety for ourselves.
We're kind of in some subtle way, perhaps harming ourselves or agitating ourselves.
And in that kind of thought experiment, it's kind of like maybe easy to understand how much our own inner life can make a certain kind of
stress that is not really necessary, but we add to the situation.
If it's possible, if we know that we added to the situation, know that we're adding it to our minds,
then perhaps, and we know that just the imagination is not really necessary.
It's not really a real thing.
Maybe it's easy to let go of it. Maybe it's easy to turn back into some calm place within,
to look for a calm, to look for a peaceful place, come back to breathing as we breathe to let go and settle back into a calm place.
So maybe that's easy to understand.
That thought experiment.
But what if it is really raining out there?
What if there's a big storm outdoors and we have to go out?
Those same kind of thoughts might be there.
How do I be safe in the rain and what do I do and how do I find my way?
But now it can be justified that we're thinking that way because it's really addressing a real world issue.
And the question is, are the agitation that we feel, are we now contributing to it?
Are we the creators of it when there's really rain out there?
Do we attribute our agitation to the rain?
Do we justify it because there really is an issue that we have to address?
And so of course we should be agitated.
Or are we able to see it there too, even when it's a real world issue, there too we are contributing the agitation.
We're caught up in the ideas and thoughts and the stress of that form of thinking is in a subtle way creating a lack of safety for ourselves.
It's harming ourselves with stress.
We're preoccupied in such a way that we don't really pay attention to the bigger picture maybe of ourselves sitting here.
And we're not safe for our place of calmness and peace within.
And whether we're going to be safe when we go out in the rain, that's one issue.
But whether our peace inside us is safe, that's a different issue.
And what if the inner peace is really important? Is it maybe more important than getting wet in the rain?
Is it more important than getting agitated while we meditate for something that's not happening here and now while we're meditating?
So this thought exercise I'm offering is meant to point out that even when we have a real world issue we're concerned with,
when we're preoccupied with it, we are in some kind of maybe mild way becoming less safe for ourselves.
We are a little bit harming ourselves. And there's a trade-off there between whatever benefits we get about thinking about the issue,
thinking about what should I wear and how should I go and what kind of umbrella should I get about the rainstorm.
And the benefits that comes from that kind of thinking, there's a trade-off with what's lost in terms of being connected to a deeper wellsprings of peace, of calm, of subtleness.
And if we evaluate the situation that way, maybe then it's easier to realize that there's no purpose right now, there's no value in sacrificing the calm and the peace.
Or it's not really to my greater benefit to lose touch with my calm and peace.
Maybe the calm, peaceful place is a place of integrity, is a place of feeling more connected to oneself, more whole.
It's a place of our intelligence, our creativity, our compassion.
It's a place where there's a wellspring of a sense of freedom in life.
So there's a ways in which our agitation, agitated mind, eclipses something precious within.
The agitated mind limits us in some way.
If we're able to settle back into a place of peace, calmness, there's a sense of unlimitedness that can be there.
There can be a sense of being connected to ourselves in a deeper way.
And not only is that place of calmness and peace safe, it turns out that the way that we think, the way that we respond to the world, understand the world,
from that place that's calm and peaceful, tends to create more worldly safety for us than if we respond to the world in an agitated way.
If the mind is jumping around and agitated, and then we act that way in the world, we don't see the situations very well, we don't see ourselves very well,
and we don't tap into our deeper understandings we have and also the deeper values that we have.
We lose touch with our core values.
So there's a calmness in Buddhism and safety.
There's one word, kema, k-h-e-m-a, that's sometimes translated as safety or security, and sometimes translated as peace or calm.
And the fact that one word encompasses both points out that these two are not so separate from each other,
that the place of calm or peace within, there's something about safety to be found in there.
And how do we contribute to the safety of our calmness, inner well-being, peacefulness?
How do we not add layers of limitations, layers of agitation, preoccupation?
So we lose touch with that. And how do we tap into the way that the calmness and peacefulness helps us to be safe in the world?
So I'm certainly capable, if I'm agitated, to be concerned about staying dry outside when it's raining.
And so I'm in a hurry or agitated, and so I just grab the first coat I can get so I can try to stay a little bit dry
and walk right by the umbrella that's by the door as I leave and not notice it.
But if I had been calm and settled and kind of gone about leaving the house in a kind of relaxed way,
of course I would have seen the umbrella. And the umbrella might have made me drier in a nice way than the particular coat that I chose to take.
So these are simple ideas and kind of analogies for what I'm trying to say.
What I encourage you to do is to really think about this and reflect on yourself.
I'll become up with better examples in your life of how this works and how the sacrifice, the downside of being agitated and preoccupied,
might be helpful for you to be a little more motivated to feel your way back into the place where things are calm and peaceful.
And what I'd like to suggest is that maybe that calm place within is not so inaccessible.
Maybe if you kind of take the time to look for it in a physical way, where is there physical calm, physical peace within?
Is it in your chest or your belly? Is it in your hands? Is it in your feet?
And it's relative, relative to how agitated you might be. Where is the place of greatest calm in your body?
And that might be the toehold into the world, this inner world of safety, inner world of calm.
And once you have a toehold there, maybe then you can breathe with it, settle with it, relax around it, value it, and a little bit protect it.
The still, quiet, peaceful place within is well worth protecting, and the primary person to protect it from is from yourself,
from the surface mind that is agitated and anxious and caught up in its preoccupations.
Your concerns might be very valuable, so valuable that maybe it's better to stay calm so that you can dress them well.
And if they're not real, if there's no rainstorm, then all the better to have not sacrificed your calm for an agitated mind.
So you might want to consider how calmness helps you to be safe.
Thank you for this morning, and I look forward to tomorrow.
