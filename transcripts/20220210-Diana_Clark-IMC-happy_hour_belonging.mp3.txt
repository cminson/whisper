The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So welcome.
Okay, so here we are on a Thursday night.
So maybe I'll start with this poem by Rosemary Trummer.
It's called You Belong Here.
And I'll talk a little bit about it, but I'll start with the poem.
So it's, now I don't remember, but I think it was August in 2020, so during the pandemic.
You belong here, here in the world of wonder and fear, of Zumba and street fights, of pink hats and pertas.
You belong here with your questions, your anger, your trust, your voluptuous cursive, your stubborn tears.
You belong here.
With your fine darkness, your involuntary shine, your shattered faith and your reckless love, your uncertainty, you belong here.
In the alleys, the rooms and the meadows, the halls and the sacred cathedral of your body.
Whether or not you asked to be here, whether or not you feel wanted here,
here is where you belong.
It is for you, the moment arrives, wondering what comes next.
It is for you, the next breath finds your body and feels you.
It is for you, this day, you, right here, where you belong.
This idea, this idea of belonging.
So this, having a sense of belongingness or feeling close to others or this sense of here is where I should be.
This part of a fundamental human motive is what sociologists would say, right, we all share this.
But there is this growing social distrust and alienation that's happening, right, you don't need me to tell you about this.
We all see it showing up in so many different ways, some of our, you know, the public discourse or
just not to mention this small little thing called a pandemic.
But this loneliness and isolation and alienation are certainly on the rise.
And, you know, I think it's the UK that's their equivalent of the surgeon general.
You know, I should be careful how I speak because I think I have, I don't know all the details about this.
But some high medical authority in some country might even be the US, I'm not even sure now that I'm speaking out loud.
But I said loneliness is one of the key things I want to focus on.
I'm thinking about, I think it's here in the US, the surgeon general.
Yeah, saying that this increase in loneliness right has such an impact on our lives in so many ways.
But the good news is that research suggests that feelings of social connection this feelings of positivity towards others, this feeling of belongingness can be increased.
We can cultivate it.
We don't just have to wait until, you know, we're specifically invited.
But instead, there are things that we can do.
One, do access service in whatever way feels meaningful for you to support community, people, you know, whomever it might be and in whatever way feels comfortable for you.
So that's the first doing access service to taking care of ourselves, reducing stress as best we can.
We all know this when we feel overburdened and stressed, then our whole little our world gets smaller and smaller and we just don't have time to reach out to others or maybe we become a little bit insensitive to the way people are reaching out to us, because we're just trying to keep our head above water.
And then the third thing, will you be surprised if I say, loving kindness meditation is a way that increases this sense of belongingness, the sense of social connection.
I've done some research on this where, you know, they give people a survey or talk to them, and then they teach them loving kindness meditation, have them do it for a certain amount of time and then do a survey talk to them afterwards and discovered that loving kindness meditation does one or two, one or the other or both outcomes.
It actually increases people's social connection, that is, they start talking to others more, they start having sharing their meals with others or volunteering, whatever it might be.
Or, and or, they just feel more connected with the connect with the relationships they already have or what they're already doing so there isn't necessarily an objective increase in their connectivity but they just feel more connected.
And that's why we do this to feel more connected.
It's not the only reason why we do loving kindness practice, but this is a fundamental human concern, you know, to not want to be completely isolated.
I can always point to some exceptions, but this idea that, you know, the sense of belonging. This part of them, I appreciated that in Rosemary Traumer's poem, she talks about, in this first stanza she says,
we belong here, here in the world of wonder and fear of Zumba, you know, this kind of group exercise, right? Street fights, we've had, we've seen on protests, right? And pink cats and protests, right?
People kind of coming together because they believed in something, they wanted to make change happen.
So there's people coming together, whether it's to dance and exercise to Zumba or to do protests.
It's a recognition that we all want to have a sense of belonging, we all want to have a sense of connection.
And during the right place, if you'd like to, if you'd like to have more of a feeling of connection.
Okay, so maybe with that as an introduction, let's do some meditation.
So we'll take a meditation posture.
Letting the body land.
Letting the eyes and letting the mind arrive in the same place where the body is.
If you'd like to be here, here, I didn't know that you're here.
Pressure against the body.
Maybe they're familiar sounds.
Sense.
Inhabiting the body.
And tuning into the sensations of breathing.
Feeling the rhythm of the breath.
This constant companion, they were often not so aware of it.
Just this gentle, easy rhythm of breathing.
Just this gentle, easy rhythm of breathing.
The rhythm in the mind wanders.
Begin again.
And then to begin our loving kindness practice.
Bringing to mind a lovable being.
We easily, the heart opens and has a warm feeling and complicated.
Somebody you know, me kittens, puppies, babies.
Somebody who has touched you with life.
Maybe they don't know about you necessarily.
They're reading their writings.
Their teachings have touched you perhaps.
Maybe the warm hearted feeling, the uncomplicated is where we start.
Bringing a lovable being to mind.
We support our intention of cultivating loving kindness.
May you be safe.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you be blessed.
May you be blessed.
Visually, or maybe there's a felt sense.
In some way, the lovable being.
Or maybe there's a feeling of openness, warmth, softness in the body.
When you bring a lovable being to mind.
May you be safe.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
Is there a way in which we can dwell in this goodwill?
Rest in the warm heartedness.
Then to expand our loving kindness to include ourselves.
May I be safe.
May I be healthy.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
May you live with ease.
You belong here with your questions, your anger, your trust, your voluptuous cursive, your stubborn tears,
you belong here.
Another line, another stands up in the poem.
With your fine darkness, your involuntary shine, your shattered faith, and your reckless love, your uncertainty, you belong here.
May you live with ease.
There's a way in which allowing ourselves to belong is related to taking care of ourselves, loving ourselves.
There's a way in which allowing ourselves to belong is related to taking care of ourselves.
There's a way in which allowing ourselves to belong is related to taking care of ourselves.
There's a way in which allowing ourselves to belong is related to taking care of ourselves.
And then expanding our loving kindness to a neutral person, somebody we don't know, somebody we don't have a relationship with.
And then to feel like they belong.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you be happy.
May you be happy.
May you be happy.
It is for you the moment arrives, wondering what comes next.
It is for you the next breath finds your body and fills you.
It's for you this day, you right here where you belong.
It is for you the moment arrives, wondering what comes next.
It is for you the moment arrives, wondering what comes next.
It is for you the moment arrives.
It is for you the moment arrives.
It is for you the moment arrives.
It is for you.
May you be safe.
May you be happy.
May you be healthy.
May you live with ease.
And then to do some equanimity practice.
This practice bringing to mind somebody that you care about and is a little bit irksome sometimes.
Not the most difficult person in your life.
You can say these phrases with this phrase.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
Thank you.
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And then maybe I'll just reread this poem.
It's You Belong Here by Rosemary Traumer.
You belong here, here in the world of wonder and fear of Zumba and street fights of pink hats and protests.
You belong here with your questions, your anger, your trust, your voluptuous cursive, your stubborn tears, you belong here.
With your fine darkness, your involuntary shine, your shuttered faith and your reckless love, your uncertainty, you belong here.
In the alleys, the rooms and the meadows, the halls and the sacred cathedral of your body.
Whether or not you asked to be here, whether or not you feel wanted here, here is where you belong.
It is for you the moment arrives, wondering what comes next. It is for you the next breath finds your body and feels you. It's for you this day, you, right here, where you belong.
So it can be helpful to talk about some of these ideas or share them with others. So I'd like to bring you to some breakout rooms where you'll have some opportunities to talk about that poem or maybe about this idea.
You don't have to like it. We don't all have to think the same.
You might say, I don't know, that was just too corny and just not my cup of tea. That's perfectly fine. Or you could say, yeah, I can feel how there's more and more isolation and more distressed apprehension and hesitation with the social connections.
And maybe how loving kindness is or isn't helpful with finding and maintaining a sense of connection, a sense of belonging.
So I'll put you into groups of three or four and you'll have 12 minutes to comment on this. And there's no need to say every single, all your ideas about this topic, but maybe just make one point and then it goes to the next person.
They say one point and then it goes to the next person. They say one point and then it comes back around. So in this way, everybody has an opportunity to hear some new ideas and to share some ideas.
Okay, so here we go.
So welcome back, welcome back everybody.
Somebody have a comment or a question or something they'd like to share. Yes, Trudy.
Yeah, let me see if I can unmute you. Or can you unmute.
See, let me know.
Yep, you're unmuted. Oh, no.
Yes, there we go. There we go. All right. I can't see. So I'm losing my eyesight. I don't know if I mentioned it, but anyway, I just wanted to get the name of the poet because it was lovely.
The name is Rosemary is her first name. She spells it like the, you know, the flower rose but Mary as in Merry Christmas.
So Rosemary. What's the last trauma T R O M M E R. Okay, trauma. Yeah.
Mary trauma or Rosemary Rosemary trauma.
Yes. That poem was so perfect. It was exactly what I needed to hear tonight. So I was really grateful.
I'm happy to hear that. That's nice tree.
Anybody else have a comment or did they like to say
Yes, Kathleen.
I just wanted to thank you for introducing the topic. I mean, you know, so often it's, it's, I find that people skirt it. It's like the big eye. We won't talk about it.
I think they're maybe, you know, what's wrong with me or what's wrong with you if you're isolated and this is just so seem to me be so healthy.
Yeah.
Thank you.
You're welcome. You're welcome, Kathleen.
Yeah. And I was, I remember that I heard this interview with the surgeon general and he was talking about this and is saying the sort of thing that people are have this thing but they don't talk about it.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll see you at the top of the hour and wishing you all a wonderful evening. And if you'd like you can unmute yourself and we'll say goodbye all together.
Bye bye.
