 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at www.adiodharma.org. So welcome. And one of the teachings of the Buddha that I love, very much appreciate, put tremendous value on, is that for there to be, for us to have care, to care for the welfare of oneself, for others, for self and others, and for the whole world. It's not one or the other, not self or others, but all four of these areas have a kind of equal value, equal weight. And it might seem a little strange to put the whole world on the scale and put oneself on the other end, say, equal weight for both. But it's true for each person that what's important is not the weight of the object of our attention, but rather the way in which our attending or care spreads from us. And sometimes I think of love or care or kindness as being a light deep in our hearts, deep in our body. And if you turned on the light and you could slow the flow of light particles, light waves, so you could kind of track how fast they spread from the center, you would see that they would actually kind of touch what's closest first, and then they go to what's next closest, and it spreads out from there. And so we know that in kind of galaxy time, that it takes a while for the light of the sun to come to us, or light that bounces off the moon to come to us. We don't see it instantaneously, we see it a little bit delayed. So our love, we turn it on, goes through us first. And so it's indiscriminate, it cares for what it lands on, but then it spreads and grows beyond that. And in that regard, what it touches first is given equal weight to what it touches later. What it touches first is just as appropriate for its care as anything else. To not have that be the case, to not have that be the case, is to turn something off in the heart. To not have care for oneself actually takes more work than to care. This implies that care is maybe different than what most people think it might be. It's something very, very simple. And this is why as we become quieter and in a certain way simpler in meditation, the care, the love, the kindness will more naturally just be here. Not maybe even intentionally directed to oneself, but rather encompassing oneself. So let's meditate and think of a process of simplification into this present moment here and now. And to gently close your eyes and bring your attention, establish your attention here in your body. Enough to familiarize yourself with how your body is now. And if kindness and care doesn't so much care, doesn't matter what it lands on, it just cares for where it lands. See if you can just be aware of your body as it is, without judgments or wanting it different. Just taking it in, being aware, registering how your body is now. And then within that body to take some long, slow, deep breaths, imagining that as the body expands, so does your kindness, your care, your love for this body. Touching it all with friendliness, goodwill. As you exhale, you're relaxing down to the very source, the little light bulb within where kindness begins. And then as you inhale, that light of kindness radiates out through your whole body and beyond, back and forth as you breathe. Relaxing as you exhale. And then, letting your breathing return to normal. Sitting here simply, sitting here gently, with the light of love or kindness, goodwill, care for yourself and for others. Radiating out with it. Maybe riding on the waves of breathing. Whatever awareness senses, knows, feels in the body and mind as you're meditating, imagine that the light of care, the light of love is included, is part of the awareness so that you're touched with love, touched with care, kindness. Not a kindness for any reason, you don't have to deserve kindness, but rather because it's the nature of light to shine and light things up. It's the nature of the heart's kindness, to touch everything with its kindness. Relaxing. in a simplicity of being. In a simplicity of being, love does not need to have a reason, does not need to have an object. Love does not need to have a reason, does not need to have an object. Love just is part of the simplicity of being. Kindness, friendliness, meta can radiate, just like a candlelight when lit radiates without discrimination for what the light lands on. It can land on anything that you are aware of. It can land on anything that you are aware of. Love does not need to have an object, but it can land on anything that you are aware of. Love does not need to have an object, And then as we come to the end of the sitting, we are going to be going to the end of the sitting. To let there be some goodwill. Even if it's goodwill, that's a wish. A wish for welfare. Some kindness, some love for yourself. Maybe with thoughts speaking to yourself or the hard feeling for yourself. Somehow, let all of who you are know your kindness for yourself, your friendliness, your respect. Maybe not because you deserve it. You probably do. But from that kindness, that care and simplicity of being, which loves just because it's the nature to love. It's nature to be kind and respectful. And to have that land on yourself. Wishing yourself well. Wishing yourself happiness, safety. And then to have that kindness. Radiate beyond yourself out into the world. Without leaving yourself behind. Almost as if you become the magnifier for the heart's capacity to care and to love as it spreads through your body and beyond. And then to wish well for everyone. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. Be free. And may many people, many beings, as possible, know that there are others who care for them, who are positively inclined, ready to be friendly, ready to support their welfare and happiness. Let people know that they're not alone in this world. There are people who care. And may we be some of those. Thank you.
