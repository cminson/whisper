So, we come to this first full morning of the retreat, actually at this point, well
into the first morning of the retreat. And I hope you find yourself settling into the
silence. And if nothing else enjoying it, what a gift to have this time of quiet. There's
a teaching from Ajahn Buddha Dastur that I've always liked. He says, there's nothing to
do and there's nowhere to go. And there's no one that you have to be. Isn't that great?
You don't have to be anybody in particular today. Just being present, giving attention
to the process that calls itself you. So, in these beginning days, it's really useful
to keep our attention gathered on the body. And in particular, to focus on breathing.
The breath is always with us until it isn't. It's consistent. It's easy. It's a good
idea to find ways to do this practice that are relatively simple. So, we let our attention
rest on the breath. And as I said last night, it's not that other things aren't going to
be happening. There will be sounds, probably, and there may be things going on in your mind
and heart. But for the most part, let them be in the background. We all know how to do
that. We all know how to bring our attention specifically to something that we're doing
and let other things be in the background. This isn't any different. So, letting your
attention rest on the breath. And rest is really important. So, don't clutch at the
breath. Don't grab at the breath. Don't pounce on it. Just let yourself relax into
the awareness of breathing. There are, for most people, places where it's easiest to
follow the breath. Some people prefer the sensations in the nostrils. Some people prefer
the rising and falling of the chest or the belly. Some people actually prefer the awareness
of the whole body breathing. And again, to find a place that is easy for you, that works
for you. And resting there, following the in-breath from its beginning through the middle to the
end of the in-breath. There might be pause at that point. And then the out-breath. Softening
into each breath. Very quickly it can become apparent that it's not so easy for the mind
to stay with the breathing. And we wake up to find out that we've gone off and planning
our daydreaming spaced out. So, when that happens, when you wake up, it really helps
to just be glad that you're awake. It does not help to scold yourself, to beat yourself
up for doing it. And then pick up the attention and bring it back to the breathing. And again,
staying there, relaxing, resting with the breathing. And again, when you go off, you
wake up, you come back. Learning to come back is one of the most important learnings in our
meditation practice.
It may be as we're sitting, that there are some strong events that really push their
way into the forefront. There might be something in the body, some pain or difficulty. It might
be something in the heart and mind. And for today, simply bring the breath to that. Breathe
into the difficulty in your body. Bring the breath to the difficulty in the mind and the
heart. Just be with it, breathing with it, until you can focus just on the breath itself.
Some people find that a simple practice of noting can be helpful as we give our attention
to our experience, using to place the mind directly in the experience. You might note
simply breathing in and breathing out. Or you might note the rising and falling of the
chest, rising and then falling. Or the same with the belly. Or the expanding and contracting
of the whole body. If you use the noting, keep it really quiet and in the background.
It's just a support.
It has been helpful for me sometimes to consider with each breath that this is the only time
and all of space and time that this breath will be here, this particular breath. So letting
yourself be interested, what kind of breath are you getting this time? Is it a long breath
or short breath, deep or shallow? See if you can meet the breath with friendliness and curiosity.
And let it be exactly the way it wants to be. There's no need to control your breathing
in this practice.
Breathing in, aware of the many sensations of breathing in. Breathing out. Different
sensations. Relaxing into each breath. Resting your attention on it.
And every time you wander off, when you wake up, come back. Begin again.
Thank you.

notice where you are now, if you've wandered off thinking, planning, daydreaming, bring
the attention back, come back to the breath, let go of everything that has
just happened up until now, and begin again. Staying primarily with the
sitting, breathing body. So again for now, as other events in the body happen to
become strong, if there's some ache or stress or pain, bring the breath to that
point, breathe into it, so you're not pushing it away, simply allowing it to be
there with the breath. One breath at a time.

sometimes as we're giving our attention to breathing, it can be helpful to bring
the attention down from the head. All too often, we are observing in our heads, see
if you can move your attention down into the heart center. The heart is quite
capable of knowing and attending. Don't make it be complicated, don't fuss about
it if it doesn't seem like it works for you, but it can be helpful as a way of
further grounding in the body. Giving our attention from the heart, being aware of
the breathing, breathing in, breathing out, rising, falling.

there's a poem I often bring to the retreat world by John O'Donohoe. He says,
I would love to live like a river flows, carried by the surprise of its own
unfolding. I would love to live like a river flows, carried by the surprise of
its own unfolding. As we sit, being with the breath, can we allow the breath to
unfold itself as it will? Long, short, deep, shallow, comfortable or not? Other
things will unfold, events in the body and the mind in the heart, and we allow
them, simply bringing the breath to those events. Taking the time to live with
that unfolding, one breath at a time, and when our attention goes away, bringing it
back over and over again.
I want to say about a first day of retreat. It's a really good day to stay in
your body, to practice primarily with the breath, as the body surfaces in one
way or another, certainly to include it, like I said, to bring the breath to
whatever is happening. The other thing to say is the first day of the retreat is
often one of the most difficult. Some of you come to this retreat out of another
retreat, so that may not be so true for those of you who are doing that, but the
body isn't used to sitting still this much, and often there's a fair amount of
restlessness or sleepiness. It's on the map, it's not because you're
doing it wrong, it happens to everyone, and it doesn't matter how many retreats
you've sat, it's still tough on the first day. So as that happens, to work with it,
and certainly for sleepiness, you can, there are several things you can do, you
can sit with your eyes open, either down towards the floor or raise them up some
distance. You cannot let the breath do what it wants to, and take in some really
good deep breaths, making sure you are bringing lots of oxygen into every cell
of your body. You can stand up and do your practice standing, and it's lovely in
a way that you're each in your own space, you don't have to trouble yourself with
some of the things that we often do, oh I don't want to stand up, everybody will
see me standing up, that's a terrible thing. It's a great thing to do, and I
loved learning many years ago that there are some monasteries in Thailand where
the practice is primarily standing, and not sitting down. So to use the standing
to bring in every, you know, bit of energy that you can, and then when things
come down again, you can sit down again. Be really kind to yourself today. This is,
as I say, it's not the easiest day of the retreat. So are there any questions
about the instructions? We have one question that came in about something
else, I'll get to that in a minute, but are there any, is there any lack of
clarity about the sitting practice, and then in a few minutes we'll talk about
the walking practice. So if you would use the mechanical thing and raise your
hand, I think that will bring you up to the top of my screen, and JD or Bob if
you see somebody you can let me know.
Everybody clear? It's great. We have a tribe of expert sitters with us this
weekend. Okay, if not, I think what I'll do is talk about the question that came
in, because it's a particular question about a particular situation, and at
the same time it probably has some application to all of you. And this is
someone on the retreat whose young grandson is coming to visit, always
comes to visit on Friday nights. What to do? And maybe the first thing to say is
what not to do is to get all fussed about it, because I have four grandsons, I
think they're great, and so having a chance to be with them is pretty amazing.
So to some extent you may have to adjust your retreat to include the
grandson, or whatever else is happening in your life, if it's not a grandson, there
may be something else that comes up for some of the rest of you. I also would
suggest that he might think it's pretty interesting that you're doing what
you're doing, and it's probably good for him to understand that sometimes people
sit and get quiet, so you can try to find a balance between giving over to him
completely, and also allowing him to see that you have a practice. He might even
want to try meditating with you. I have a very happy memory, I was thinking about
it after I saw this question, with one of my grandsons who just did not believe
that he could be silent for even five minutes. So we had a challenge, and he
got to meditate and follow his breath, and he figured out that he could do it.
It wasn't easy, but he could do it. So let yourselves, please let yourselves be
flexible around the realities of your practice at home, whatever that may be.
One suggestion that was made, often if we are, of course those of you who are
old IRC hands know this very well, there's always work practice. There's the
time in the morning when everybody does a little bit of cleaning, and everybody
has a job, and part of the intention of that is to learn how to bring your
awareness into your everyday life. We were talking about it before the
sitting in the teacher group, and I wanted to suggest that you can find some
meditative work in your own home, some chore that you do maybe every day, but
the dishes or, you know, tidying up or whatever, and make that your work
practice. Bring some very clear intention to it. So it's not just,
oh it's time to do the dishes, and you do them sort of not thinking about it, but
this is a particular meditation period in your day that you have, the 15 or 20
minutes to do the dishes, or clean up, or make your bed, or whatever it is that
you're doing. So each of you can find your own work meditation, we obviously
can't assign them in this case, but we really encourage you to do it as part of
your practice. And then the other thing to say is we aren't having practice
discussions today, they will start tomorrow. We're not sure that everybody
has signed up, there are a few spaces left in a couple of JD's groups, so if
you have not signed up, please do so. And if you're not going to do a
practice group for any reason, please let us know. That way we're aware that
you're okay. So, but we really invite you to come to those groups. And you know, I
often tell people, I love having those groups because then I get to know who's
out there, and I've been doing this for a long time now, but I still, at the
beginning of retreat, I look out at a group and go, oh they don't like me, I'm
a terrible teacher. And then we have these conversations, and I hear about
practice, and it's very sweet, and it's like, oh okay, this is good, I'm happy,
I'm with friends. So please come and be friends with us, and we'll talk about
practice. It's a very, very good thing to do. So lastly, I want to say something
about walking practice. I don't know how much has already been said, because I
wasn't here this morning. But we are now going to have another period of walking,
and of course the retreat is set up with periods of alternating sitting and
walking. As I said yesterday, if you're at all walking challenged, please arrange
your movement time in such a way that it works for you. And if at least at one
point or another in the day, if you want to do some other kind of mindful
movement like yoga or qigong or something of that sort, if you have that kind of
practice, feel free to do that. But the walking itself is actually really, really
important. It balances the energy. If you just sit the body after a while, it's not
so useful. And so to meditate while walking, one of the postures that the
Buddha gives us, is a way of working with the energy of the body differently. It's
every bit as important as sitting practice. It's so easy to sort of make it
secondary in our own minds, but it's not. One of the things about walking is that
when we walk, you actually have your whole body to give your attention to as it
moves through space. And so that's a, it's a very big object to rest your
attention on. And it's a little easier sometimes than the breath. The breath can
get kind of subtle. And so giving your attention to your walking, and then of
course coming back every time you wonder off, is a very useful way to practice. So
find a place either inside your home or outside, where you can walk back and
forth. It doesn't have to be very long. 20, 25 feet is plenty. And less than that
will work if you're inside and you have a room that is smaller. And find
yourself your starting place and then stand there. And notice standing. Notice
the weight on your feet. Notice your body stacked up over your feet all the way
up to your head. And then when you're ready, take a step. Often we suggest that
this be quite slow. That you lift the foot and move it forward, and then place
it. Noticing the sensations of the foot as you place it. And then shifting the
weight slowly, slowly, and lifting up the other foot, moving it forward, and
placing it. I find that it's really helpful with walking to think of it a
little bit. You have, it's like you have gears. Well, we used to have gears in a
car. I guess we don't anymore. But you, we know that you can go slowly or you can
go medium fast or you can go really fast. And the same is true in our walking. So
if you're kind of sluggish today at some point, you might want to do a period of
fairly fast brisk walking back and forth. Step, step, step, step, step, step. When
you get to the end of your lap, you're going to turn, noticing the turning, and
then back. Step, step, step, step, step. You can go medium pace, lifting, placing,
lifting, placing. Or you can go very, very slowly, noticing all the tiny
sensations that happen in the feet and the legs. There's nothing particular you
have to do with your hands except find a place to keep them so that again, they're
comfortable and not distracting. And for the most part, you can do this with your
eyes open. It can be interesting to do it with your eyes closed. And if you have a
place where you can run your hand along a bookshelf for a while, play with it if
you'd like, because that focuses the awareness a bit more just in the
sensations of the body. And again, at each end of your lap, stop, make sure you're
there, then turn, and then come back the other way. And if at any point, you
suddenly realize that you're planning something for next week instead of
walking here, stop again, bring yourself back, and then continue. So are there any
questions about the walking practice itself? Are we good? Looks like we are. So
maybe I'll bring you that poem one more time, because I think it's such a good
retreat poem, you know, about being carried by the surprise of your own
unfolding. So who knows what will unfold in this retreat? You don't know. And it's
not necessary for you to know. What's great is you might get surprised. So here
it is again. I would love to live like a river flows carried by the surprise of
its own unfolding. So may your day go peacefully and unfold well. We have 45
minutes for walking now, and then we'll be back in here for another sitting. Thank
you.
