 A concept that sometimes goes along with the unification of the mind, the gathering together of the mind, or gathering together of all of our faculties, not just the mind, is intimacy. It's a big intimate with your experience. The instructions today will be about mindfulness of emotions. And there's a way of being intimate with emotions, or unified with them, that can be a different way of mindfulness of emotions than how many people will relate to emotions. This idea of learning a new way to see them, a new way of being with emotions, can be quite helpful if the usual way is one that identifies with them strongly, meaning that we define ourselves by our emotions, or whether we feel like we're somehow separated from our emotions like we're the victim of them, or we are somehow holding ourselves away from them in the control tower, or we're leaning into them. Sometimes there's an intelligence in emotions, kind of sinking in them, or losing ourselves in them, and all kinds of things that go on. So for this kind of new way of seeing, new way of being, sometimes new language is useful. This idea that we're in the control tower, that there's some central place where we're the agent, we're the doer, we're the experiencer of things, sometimes holds back from a certain kind of intimacy. So the language of mindfulness of the body can be that which is mindful of the body, as if it's two different things. Another way of talking about it is not mindfulness of the body, but the body's mindfulness. The awareness, the sensing, the way the body senses itself. We only feel our body through the senses that are in the body, the nerve endings that are in the body, and the sensations that we have are so intimate with the act of sensing that there is no difference, there's no real clear distinction between sensing and sensations while they're happening. That's intimate. That's the body's mindfulness, the body's capacity for awareness and knowing. One of the ways to be mindful of emotions is to feel the emotions in their physicality, how they're sensed and felt in the body. And for some people that could be an alternative way of being with emotions than it is to be in the control tower or something like that, where maybe there are stories running, the emotions elicit stories and beliefs, ideas, predictions of the future. I'll always be this way. Or if this continues, X will happen. Why is this happening to me? Sometimes the emotions are triggered by stories we're telling ourselves, memories we have and imaginations we have. When we drop down to the body's mindfulness, the body's way of feeling, sensing emotions, it can be seen as being very respectful of the emotions. The emotions are allowed to be there. But it's being a present for them without doing so through the filter of the story-making mind, the meaning-making mind, the predictive mind that predicts what this means, where this is going. And it's quite a different thing to feel emotions physically in the body. And the body has kind of a different capacity to be with emotions than the mind does, than the thinking mind, meaning-making mind, and places of imagination. And one of the reasons it's respectful to feel emotions in the body is that the body is always fluid, believe it or not, much more than we allow ourselves to feel. The body, if it's really, really left alone, can process whatever is in it, whatever is there, at least emotionally process it. The body is intelligent. It's possible that your body, I don't want to claim it's true for all of you, I don't want to respect your intelligence that you think you have. But it's possible that your body is more intelligent than you. Wouldn't that be pretty wonderful? Like you have this extra thing going along that's supporting you, helping you, guiding you. And so there's a dropping down into the body to feel the emotions. And from there, let there be a clear seeing of emotions. Oh, this is what it's like to be with sadness. This is what it's like to be with anger. This is what it's like to be with happiness or joy. And this language of with is different than saying this is what it's like to be sad. This is what it's like to be angry, be happy. And there's a way that it's very respectful to add the word with. For you, for your body, for the whole, for the emotion itself, this is what it's like. And then be with the body's awareness, the body's mindfulness of the emotion. And you probably discover at some point that the way the emotions are felt in the body is a little bit fluid. It morphs and changes and the location kind of comes and goes and arises and passes, moves around. That it's not a solid, hard and fast thing from the point of view of the body. And to be in this receptive mode in the body. So to begin the sitting, to take a few long, slow, deep breaths. And those deep breaths can be a way of making room for the body's mindfulness. To feel and sense the body. Standing on the exhale. And letting your breathing return to normal. The change of language around breathing can be helpful. Rather than being aware of the breathing as if you're in the control tower looking at it or directing attention towards the breathing. You might try receiving breathing in the body, receiving the sensations. As if breathing wants to be known. It's making itself known for you, for you to receive it. And if it feels that you're controlling your breath a lot or it's struggling, maybe to feel the breathing body in the back rib cage. A location where there's not much control, just a subtle movement. One place where there's a light touch, where the body sensations of breathing lightly touch awareness. And if as you're sitting here, some emotion becomes prominent. Take time for the body to experience it. What parts of your body are activated by whatever mood or emotional state you have? Or what part of the body is it expressed in or felt in? Respecting the emotion, the mood, the attitudes you have, respecting them enough to not act on them, but to simply feel them in the body. If the emotion is strong, maybe having the word with you is a way of allowing yourself to receive it without making it the whole story. Maybe breathing with the emotion, breathing through it. Maybe it is a way of de-emphasizing the stories and ideas about it. Maybe it is a way of allowing yourself to receive it without making it the whole story. It's possible to breathe with your emotion. It's also possible to let your emotions, your mood, be with your breathing. Almost as if it's part of the unification, the gathering together, the whole that's here with breathing at the center. It's possible to let your emotions, your mood, your emotions, your emotions, your emotions, your emotions. Sometimes what we might include under emotions is what in English we call reactions, or reactions to things. And when there are reactions, there's often a way in which we're separated, the objects of the reaction that somehow separate from the immediacy of our direct embodied experience. Trust the body, trust how the body receives whatever's happening. Without being in the control tower where the thoughts, the ideas, and the objectification of things can take over. It's possible to let your emotions, your mood, your emotions, your emotions, your emotions, your emotions, your emotions, your emotions, your emotions. It's possible to let your emotions, your emotions, your emotions, your emotions, your emotions, your emotions, your emotions, your emotions. Similar to how everything on our planet is pulled by gravity towards the center. So in you, if you relax, putting everything kind of settle towards the center, be gathered together unified so all of who you are gathers, relaxing the body, the heart, the mind, the mind, the thoughts. Second announterm? And if in your body there are any sensations associated with a well-being, some do we have contentment or calmness? Let that be received in the body as a way of supporting you to be centered here in the present moment with your breathing. And if in your body there are some sensations associated with your breathing, some do we have contentment or calmness? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Part of being aware of your emotional state is to be aware of your relationship to it. Very simply, are you for or against it? Holding onto something or resisting something? Trying to fix it or stop it, not have it there or try to hold onto it, make it more. Do you define yourself by it? So it becomes a judgment about yourself. And chances are that if you're aware of your relationship to an emotion, you can also feel that sometimes that's a holding yourself away from or holding yourself being in such a way that you don't feel the intimacy of the emotion by itself. Looking for intimacy without entanglement. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. In the language spoken by the Buddha, there doesn't seem to be a good word to represent the English word emotion. So then you might wonder, well, maybe they didn't have emotions back then. That would explain something about Buddhism. But actually, they had just a whole range of emotions that we have. But they saw the human experience differently. And it's easy in our language sometimes to think of emotions as a thing, whereas the Buddha saw it as a composite that's made up of different things. And when we're reacting to emotions, it's often like we're reacting to the thing, the sadness, the anger, the happiness, whatever it might be, the conceit. But to see it more as a composite, then we can drop down and feel some of the component parts. And a very important part of the emotions is the physicality of it. Sometimes difficult to feel, but it's a way if you can feel it where it's expressed or manifests in the body, fear in the belly perhaps or in the chest, anger in the belly perhaps or in the hands. Maybe there's contentment that seems to spread out through the chest, down through the arms. There's all these different ways, each person's going to be different. And sometimes you can see in other people when their emotions are strong, you can see what parts of the body are tense or activated. As we meditate, revealing our body from the inside out, we have access to the more subtleties of how emotions are living and alive in our body. And it turns out it's very wise to feel emotions in that part of it, that component part which has to do with its physicality. Because the physical side, as I said, is not the story, which is another component part. And that's where we tend to get caught in sometimes reinforcing it or reacting to it. It's easy to be kind of separated by the story. But to feel it. And then there's a much better chance that the emotion can move. Remember the word motion is in emotion, that it can move and shift and change in maybe very subtle ways, maybe the boundaries of it, the edges of the emotion, where it is in the body is shifting and changing, maybe something, how is it shifting and changing? What's the movement in the body of the emotion? It's also a way of trusting the inner wisdom of the body that knows what you need to experience. Sometimes annoyance needs to become rage before it can be healed. Sometimes sadness needs to be grief. Sometimes grief needs to become peace. Who knows what direction this goes and how it morphs? But by trusting the body experience, we can allow something to shift and change. That's harder to do if we are living in the control tower with judgments, ideas, stories, meaning of what I need, what I don't need, what I can do, what I can't do. And I'll say finally that... So to be able to just know you're having an emotion and to name it, to see it, oh, this is joy, this is sadness, is actually a powerful thing, just that, to recognize it. If you add the word with, then it kind of maybe feels a little bit like it's not the whole picture, it's not the universe, it's just this one thing. To feel it in the body is a way of finding a little more freedom with it, hopefully. Though sometimes it doesn't, sometimes if you feel it strongly in the body or feel it, it actually can trigger some stronger reactivity that can cascade. And if that's the case, you don't have to sit with the emotion, you can always open your eyes and breathe deeply and look out the window, or you're not stuck here with it all. But there is something very significant about, metaphorically, if not literally, about the meditation posture. To be able to sit in a way that's appropriate for each of us in a kind of dignified way, upright way, and allow whatever we're feeling, whatever the emotions are, to exist with us without getting entangled. If I am sitting here in the early morning and have started the breakfast preparations, and I realize that instead of putting the prunes to stew, I put the walnuts in to stew. So I'm sitting and meditating, but suddenly I realize what has happened. One way to do realize that is to go like this, literally, in meditation. Oh no! Now I'm involved. I've collapsed into it. Another way is to, no one would know, I know, that I feel all kinds of disturbing emotions on the walnuts instead of the prunes, but it's all being felt in here. I don't pull back, I don't close down, I don't collapse. I just, you know, I don't get angry with the person who brought the walnuts. Maybe I do, but I don't make a fist. I just sit there. So there's a way of respecting these emotions, deep, deep respect, without getting entangled, without the reactivity that pulls into it or collapses into it or resists or fights or identifies, that's metaphorically represented by the posture. What you should actually do is maybe conditional by the situation, but the idea of respecting it all, feeling it in the body, knowing it's there, breathing with it, being patient, giving it its time, curious about the shifting, shaping, morphing, amoeba-like nature of how emotions are felt and experienced. You don't have to do this all the time, but just when the emotions are compelling, predominant, they really kind of are calling for attention. Or if there's good emotions, good feelings that are present, even if they're subtle, but they clearly kind of are like a little bit of a holding container or support for staying concentrated, for staying with the emotions. Let the good feelings help you be present, even if they're subtle. Don't hold on to them, don't expect them, but just gently receive them and let them support, for example, mindfulness of breathing. It's a rich world, and these are just a few words of ideas, and it will take years for each of us to learn the vocabulary and the practices and way of respecting our inner life. But it's a wonderful journey to do this, rich and valuable. And we can talk more about it in the practice discussion if you wish. A couple of things about today, I'd like to suggest that as you go about IRC, walking down the steps, walking across the community hall, wherever you're going to go, whatever you're doing, walk at the speed by which you know when you've lost touch with your body. If you go too fast, you'll probably lose touch with your body quickly. Really know that you're connected in some kind of good quality way, like you're in your body, you're present, you're experiencing it like you would in walking meditation, perhaps. So whatever speed that allows you to stay close, so that you notice when your mind gets into your thoughts and you're kind of left your body. So experiment with that speed. See that that really helps you stay present much more throughout the day. Because that's one of the ways this retreat practice builds, is when you have more and more continuity in the practice through the day, not just in sitting, not just in walking. And because we're kind of in the middle now section of this journey, it's particularly important for everyone, for us to be really respectful of the noble silence. That's an easy way to kind of begin losing the momentum or the container. So please, you know, only do the absolutely necessary speech, like if you're working with someone or something. And we'll do the COVID testing this evening. And if everyone's negative, my masks will be optional. But we'll talk more about that at the Dharma talk, how that's done. And so we have practice discussion today. And I think that Kim is going to meet people in the body deck. Ying will meet people first in the treehouse deck, at the end of the body deck. There's two times for her. And I'll be with people in the treehouse deck. And if you go to the treehouse deck, you'll see there's a long wooden walkway along the side of the building. There's a chair halfway. You can just wait by the chair for the person in front of you to leave. When you leave, rather than... Don't go back up the woodwalk walkway and past the other person. If you make a very sharp right, if you go down those few little steps from the deck, there's a little path that's a little bit hard to see, a little path that goes... It curves around, it brings you back to the big redwood grove right there, to the main trail there. So you're making kind of a circle. And I hope you enjoy your day and respect everything.
