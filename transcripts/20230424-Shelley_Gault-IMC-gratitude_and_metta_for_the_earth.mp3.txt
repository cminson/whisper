The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org.
I think we can begin now. Can you hear me? My audible? Good, okay. It's really nice
to be here. I've taught Happy Hour quite a few times before. Some of you might
not know me. I live in Santa Barbara, which is, you know, about several hundred
miles down the coast from from IMC and IRC. And I love to be invited to
teach Happy Hour when one of the regular teachers isn't available. And today
I'm subbing for Nicky, who's teaching at IRC. She's teaching a retreat this
week with Diana Clark, a mental retreat. So I'm sure the people there, and I know
some people from this group are, you know, regular participants in Happy Hour,
are there at IRC. And you guys can hold down the fort for them till they get
back. So Saturday, two days ago, was Earth Day, which it's kind of odd. It
seems to me that we, Earthlings, needed to create a special day to remind ourselves
that Earth is our home, you know. And as I mentioned, I live in in Santa Barbara.
And in January of 1969, so that's, there's that's 50, 53, 54 years ago, there was an
oil spill here. It was a really big oil spill here. It doesn't compare with some
of the monster ones that have occurred since, but it was really big. And there
was a platform offshore, and no one of the big oil platforms offshore. A well
just exploded from the bottom, and the oil found up into the water, and then,
you know, floated on the top, as oil does. And it covered an area of 800 square
miles on the surface of the ocean, Pacific Ocean. And then, of course, it came
to came to the shore. And there were many, many thousands of seabirds and marine
mammals that were killed, and it was really, it was quite something. And I
remember, I was here at the time, I was in college at that time, that's how old I
am. And I remember we couldn't hear the sound of the surf because the the oil, you
know, it calmed the waves so much that it was was very eerie, really. And the
beaches were black. And the technology for dealing with such things didn't work
very well then, and I don't know if it works very well now, either. But there were
hundreds of people who volunteered to clean seabirds, gulls, and pelicans,
interns, and many, many kinds of birds, and was baby oil and bath towels. He was
to try to clean them. And a year later, a year after that, sparked partially by
what had happened in Santa Barbara, and also, I think, also sparked by the first
photographs of our planet, a little blue planet that were ever taken from space by
the astronauts who were on their way to the moon, or maybe on their way back, I
don't remember which. But a year after that, the first Earth Day was celebrated
in 1970. And those photos of the Earth, they became really iconic, I think. And I
think they still have the power to really wake us up to the fact that here we
are. You know, what we have here is very precious. It's very small. It's very
precious. Humans, you know, here we are in this little orb in space, the only place
we know of in the universe that supports life. That's quite something, you know. We
belong to this Earth. You know, we belong to the Earth. Life arose somewhere, you
probably deep in the oceans is what they think now, about a billion years after
the Earth first took shape, really formed. And it arose because the conditions
were just right. You know, we often talk about conditions being right for things
to happen in Buddhism. The conditions were just right for life to appear. The
right mix of chemicals, the right temperature, the right pH, the right
amount of sunlight, something in that combination allowed some DNA to form in
what we would now call a cell. And from that early beginning, it took like
something like three and a half billion years from then for humans to
eventually arise on the planet. It's quite something. We're the product of a
very long, very slow history of more and more complex life forms developing, so
gradual. And so we exist, you know, thanks to this whole history, this entire history
gave birth to us along with everything else that's alive today. And as life
forms became more complex, you know, organisms became more and more dependent
on other organisms in order to survive. The first, the first little one-celled
animals, or they weren't really animals. We thought there were, there was no
division between animals and plants at that time. They were just some kind of
organism. They fed on chemicals in the water. They didn't feed on other, you know,
plants or other animals. And then later, as they developed other organisms
developed, and organisms began to live on other organisms. And about one and a
half billion years ago, that's when life, as it was then, kind of divided into
plants, fungi, you know, like mushrooms and things like that, and animals. It's like
one and a half billion years ago. And the three groups began gradually to depend
on each other, to depend on each other for food, for an environment to live in,
for making their lives possible. And today, the systems that make up, that make
all the organisms on earth able to survive are so complex, you know, they're
so interdependent as to be almost impossible to map, you know. The Buddha
used to talk about the imponderables sometimes, the things that could not be
really known. And it's so complex, we couldn't know that. I think it's one of
the imponderables. And I think, you know, many, scientists actually estimate that
there are about almost nine million different species of living things,
living beings on this planet. That's really a lot of different kinds of
creatures, you know, of beings. And many humans don't seem to grasp the
importance of this interdependence. But I think our practice and Dharma
understanding, they teach us that everything depends on everything else,
you know. Everything is conditionally arisen. As the 19th century environmentalist
and founder of the Sierra Club, John Muir once said, when we try to pick out
anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in the universe. When we
try to pick out anything by itself, we find it hitched to everything else in
the universe. He wasn't a Buddhist, but that's really a very much a Dharma
statement, I think. So today seemed to me like a really good time to practice
gratitude for the interdependent web of life on this earth that we are a part of.
And to offer blessings to all parts of that web, including ourselves, of course.
So let's let's do that now. You'd like to make yourselves comfortable. Find ease in
your posture. You know, it's important to feel at ease when we do our practices.
Relaxation, comfort. And you might want to spend a little time with the
breath with your breathing, unless that's not a good anchor for you. And then
something else that helps you, helps you to be at ease, to help to settle you. If
it's the breath, just let the rhythm of that be settling, relaxing.
Just feel into your presence, sitting wherever you are. We're spread, you know,
all over the landscape of this country, the United States, and of the earth as
well, people from other continents, other countries. We're all in
different places, but we're connected by our intention to offer care to others,
to ourselves, to receive care. All of us here, living on earth, supported by so
many living things, so many living things. And by the earth itself, the rocks and the
sand and the stone and the water, the soil, by the air that surrounds us, not
separate from this world, we're part of it, and we're welcome here. It's our home. So I
invite you just first to turn, turn your attention to something a little bit
amorphous, which is the atmosphere around us. You might not often think that, you
know, that part of the sky that touches us is part of the earth, you know, but it
really is the atmosphere's part of the earth. And the clouds in the sky made of
water, you know, recycling water that evaporates from all the water surfaces on
the planet, and then recondenses way up high in the sky. Clouds that rain and
nourish all the plants, fill the aquifers, fill the lakes in the streams, just
replenishing the water that all beings on and below the surface of the earth
depend on. Breathe in our gratitude for the water in the clouds, water that
supports all of life that we could not live without. And we can breathe out our
care, our meta, our friendliness for all the kinds of beings that are blessed by
the water in the world. Breathing in the gratitude for the water that's, that's
needed for life, and breathing out meta for all who needed, including us.
The air itself, almost all living beings breathe in some way. We as mammals, we
breathe in and the, the oxygen in the air crosses thin, thin membranes in our
lungs and enters our blood. It fuels all the activity in all our cells. Every time
we breathe in, breathe in appreciation, gratitude for the air we breathe, and
exhaling with our thanks. Breathing in gratitude and breathing out meta for
everything that breathes. From the tiniest insect to the largest mammal, all
the birds, the undersea creatures, breathing through different means, all the
plants. We all breathing beings breathe freely, including us.
And then the ground, the earth beneath our feet, the low places, the
deserts, the mountains, soil and stone and sand, all made of minerals, the same
minerals that make up our bodies, the bodies of all living beings. We are made
of this earth, the earth that we walk on. All beings everywhere are made of earth.
Breathing in gratitude for the support of the earth. I'm breathing out meta for
all the beings made from the earth. Breathing out blessings for all the beings
who live here, great or small, seen or unseen, born and yet to be born,
including all of us.
And then all the plants that are rooted in this ground,
absorbing minerals from the soil, absorbing the water from the soil,
taking in carbon dioxide from the air, making their own food from the water
and the carbon dioxide, and then breathing out oxygen into the air so that
other beings can breathe it in. Becoming food for other beings from the tiniest
to the biggest, being digested and then being added back to the soil and
enriching it. Breathing in gratitude for all the green plants from the tiniest
right up to the giant redwoods, and breathing out offering them thanks for
nourishing us with both food and oxygen, allowing so many beings that walk on the
earth and fly in the sky to live.
May we always be grateful for the plants that feed us, for the oxygen that
supports our life.
Thank you.
And then all the beings that walk on the surface and fly in the air, including us,
we all live in dependence on each other. Many provide food for others, and when our
lives end and our bodies decompose, they can feed the soil that feeds the plants.
The plants depend on the walking and flying beings for pollination, for
fertilizing the soil they grow in, for dispersing their seeds, and the animals
depend on the plants for food, for shelter and protection. There's a web of
mutual dependency that all living beings have a part in. All living beings are in
this together. May all beings be safe. May they live their lives in the way that is
most natural for them. May they fulfill their parts in the cycle of life
without interference. May they thrive, including us.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
When I eat an apple, I'm grateful for the tree and grateful for the insect that
pollinated the apple blossom so that it could become a fruit, and for the soil
that supported the health of the tree and the rain that gave it water, and the
farmer who cultivated the orchard, and the workers who picked the fruit, and the
drivers who delivered it to the store, and to all the people there who unpacked
it and displayed it and put it in a bag for me to take home. And that's only a
very, very small fraction of all the beings that had a part in making that
apple available. May we be grateful for this great web of living beings that
supports all life, including ours all the time. May we not forget that we are
part of that great web, that we are made of the same materials as the earth.
May our gratitude grow.
May this whole web of life continue. May it be protected. May it flourish.
May we be grateful for this great web of life.
May we be grateful for this great web of life.
May we be grateful for this great web of life.
May we be grateful for this great web of life.
May we be grateful.
May we be grateful for this great web of life.
May we be grateful for this great web of life.
May I not forget that I am part of this web dependent on many, many others
May I play my part in this web well. May my life be a support to life on earth
as the earth has supported me for my entire life.
May my life be a support to life on earth as the earth has supported me for my entire life.
May my life be a support to life on earth as the earth has supported me for my entire life.
May my life be a support to life on earth as the earth has supported me for my entire life.
May my life be a support to life on earth as the earth has supported me for my entire life.
May my life be a support to life on earth as the earth has supported me for my entire life.
May my life be a support to life on earth as the earth has supported me for my entire life.
May all beings be safe and protected from harm.
May all beings be peaceful and happy.
May all beings have health and strength as much as is possible.
May all beings live in the way that is most natural for them.
May all beings be free.
May all beings be free.
May all beings be free.
So, thank you for your practice this evening, this afternoon, this late night, whatever it is for you.
And now we have an opportunity to meet in smaller groups and to share a little bit about our practice, about what's going on in our Dharma lives.
And just as a reminder, when we break up into breakout groups, please allow each person sharing to stand on its own without offering advice or asking questions.
And it's always fine to pass if you don't want to speak. Nobody's obligated to share, although of course everybody is welcome to.
And, you know, sometimes people really benefit from hearing others but just don't feel comfortable sharing themselves, so it's really fine to pass.
And please make sure that everyone gets a chance, you know, if you can see the time is passing and not everyone has had an equal chance to speak, it's fine to speak up and say, maybe we should move on to the next person.
So I'm going to make some rooms, create some breakout rooms. I think I'll put three people in a room and might be two people in one room.
And let's see, we'll have, I think, 10 minutes and then there'll be a countdown for another minute, so you'll have a total of 11 minutes and I'm going to send you off into the ethers.
There, anybody who'd like to share, I see some smiles. If you'd like to raise your zoom hand, that'd be great.
If you'd like to bring something into the room. Yeah, Wayne, can I meet yourself?
I actually missed the first little few minutes of this and I kind of caught on quickly while we were relating it to Earth Day and I read a fair bit about the environment and things and I was kind of trying to stay positive.
I think I might have brought some not so positive news. Some distress.
I recently, I think it might have, I don't know, in the last day or two, seeing a picture of some farmers that normally bees will pollinate the crop or the flower that they grow but they're having to do it by climbing all the ladders and touching them all into different.
From one flower to another.
The fruit and just thinking of how laborious that is, but that's what they've been growing for a long, long time.
Yeah, well maybe we should have another session where we do compassion rather than meta and gratitude because that's definitely needed.
I was on a bike ride yesterday with several friends and I hadn't done a whole in the Berkeley Hills and I hadn't done a lot of hill climbing and after about 30 miles and I had only eaten a banana in the morning and I didn't.
Usually I forgot to bring all these little gummy things that sports stores sell and I just, I don't know if you've heard of bonking, but I bonked. I told them I knew the way back and I knew I was near a store that I was aware of and I went and got some sweets and a thing of Gatorade and just sat down and actually my son called me from Chicago while I was sitting there.
And so it turned out to be a wonderful experience and I tried to go up the hill and I said forget it, I'm just going to ride down to Rockridge Bart and take Bart to a rinde where my car was parked.
Did you say you had gone 30 miles though, Moyne?
Yeah, it's a prep ride for a century. I'm not doing the century, I'm working the century, but it just reminded me of my God, if that's only one fourth of the century.
That was a lot, yeah. I bet it was really beautiful though, I mean.
There are some pretty parts, yeah.
Yeah, it's such a gorgeous spring here in California, it's just very fortunate.
Thank you.
Thanks. Jesse.
Yeah, thank you. This was a wonderful practice. I just wanted to express my gratitude. I do practice sometimes mindfulness of the body where I go through the elements.
Earth, water, fire, wind, and it just felt so beautiful to think about the earth itself, the atmosphere of the earth, the water, the different layers of the planet.
I hadn't heard this before and I guess what it opened up for me is to think of the earth as a friend.
This gratitude practice I do for myself, I do it, I guess it's a mindfulness of the body practice, the elements, but I do it in the context of a loving kindness practice.
So here, this too, with the gratitude for the earth, I thought that was really beautiful.
Yeah, great, thank you. I hadn't thought of it as an elements practice really, but that's what it is.
So yeah, gratitude for the elements outside as well as inside, our experience of all that.
Thanks a lot, Jesse.
Anybody else?
Yeah, it's a very tender time for the earth, isn't it? It really needs our support, our blessing in a way, to walk on it in a way that supports it somehow.
And I think we can all find ways to, you know, just to love, to show our love, to love the earth and to show it, because we're all part of it and it's part of us.
Yeah, Hugh.
Oh, yes, thank you, Shelley. As you were saying, you said earlier that evolution has gone through this process of creating ever more and more complex creatures and everything, and more and more interrelated, interconnected,
culminating, I think, frankly, in the creation of lots of Homo sapiens, and it's the most complex creatures that we are created to do what?
To care for, I think to care for this earth that created us, now it's our turn, to give elder care to the spirit earth.
That's right, yeah, we need to take care of our parents for sure.
It's our mother, our father, our, you know, our creator.
Yeah, thank you, Hugh.
Uh-huh.
Well, I wish you all a really lovely week and with tenderness, you know, and joy as well.
Things can be tough and also we can find joy.
It's such a beautiful place where we live, that we're part of, that we belong to, so may you all have a great week, may you all have a great life.
And see you next time. Blessings.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Thank you.
Thanks everyone.
Thanks.
Thanks.
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I agree.
Ready to eat that grass, yes.
