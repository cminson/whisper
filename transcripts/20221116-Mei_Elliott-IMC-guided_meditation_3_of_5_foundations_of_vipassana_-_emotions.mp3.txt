 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Okay, well my name is Mae Elliott, and we are doing a week-long study on the foundations of Vipassana meditation. Today's instructions are about emotions. This includes moods and mind states. This is a really wide field, and learning to practice skillfully with it can have a huge impact on our lives. And on a really simple level, we're learning how to let emotions come and go without tampering with them, without biting them, or without judging them. So there's a practice I'd like to introduce you to. It's called RAFT, and it's an acronym that stands for recognize, allow, feel, and tease, or tease apart. So we'll be going through these four parts of RAFT in the meditation today, and then unpacking them further in the talk at the end. Now, RAFT is particularly useful for difficult emotions and moves, sadness, grief, resentment, anger, etc. But for the sake of this meditation, if there aren't any difficult emotions present, you don't need to go looking for them. You can still apply this instruction to whatever mood or emotion is happening for you. And it might be a really subtle mood that's in the background, and so we're not needing to dredge up anything intense with this. So let's go ahead and start our morning meditation together. We can begin with a stable posture with alert and relaxed. And you might connect with your primary anchor. That might be the breath for you. The sounds in the room, or a global sense of the bodily posture. I'll be giving instructions with the breath to start, but go ahead and apply them to whatever your anchor is. So to help settle and collect the mind. We might take a few deep breaths. And allow the breath to resume a normal rhythm. Allowing the mind to become interested in the breath. Collecting here into the present moment. So if thoughts arise during the meditation, you can gently release them. And glide right back to the breath. So Thank you. Thank you. As we sit, letting go of our preoccupations, letting go of our preoccupations, letting go into the body, into the felt sense of breathing. As we do this, you might notice if a particular mood or emotion is present. It's okay if it's overt, it's okay if it's subtle. It might just be a faint background mood. Maybe a little calm or contentment, maybe a little agitation or striving. We can begin with our emotions by simply recognizing the first practice of left, recognizing. Just knowing. Oh, happiness, or oh, this is sadness, or self-judgment. Whatever is being noticed can be noticed cleanly and simply. It's okay if you don't have a name for the emotion. If you can't figure out what emotion it is, that's totally fine. You might just note emotion. You may notice that the mood or emotion changes as we sit. The second part of this practice is allowing. Whatever arises is welcome. There's no need to resist anything that comes up in meditation. When you fold everything in, nothing is good. It's okay if you don't have a name for it. If you're at any point, the mood or emotion is no longer predominant. You can return to your breath or your primary anchor. You can return to your breath or your primary anchor. Allowing whatever arises to be known in the light of awareness. You can return to your breath or your primary anchor. You can return to your breath or your primary anchor. You almost always have a physical manifestation that might be tingling in your chest, a sense of lightness or heaviness, contraction in the belly or the forehead, heat, pressure, etc. See if you can connect with whatever emotion or mood may be present through the felt sense of the body. Thank you. If it's helpful, you can apply a soft mental note to whatever you're experiencing. Tingling, tightness, warmth, keeping the note light in the background and the actual sensation in the foreground. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Tingling our emotional life in the body. Allowing whatever sensations we find there to be. Tingling to judge or to fight with. Tingling whatever we find with the curiosity of a scientist. Nothing personal. Nothing's a problem. Nothing personal. Nothing personal. Nothing personal. And this last piece of working with emotions is tease, tease apart. So for this piece of the practice, it's supposed to be simple. It's teasing apart the difference between the storyline or any narrative associated with the emotion. We're teasing apart the felt sense of the emotion and how it's experienced in the body, seeing the difference between the mental and physical manifestations. We're getting clear about what's extra. Maybe there's an extra layer of self judgment or resistance or a wish to fix whatever emotion is present. So teasing apart to be able to see that. Tingling our emotional life in the body. Maybe it's teasing apart the emotion from the identification of the emotion. Tingling our emotional life in the body. Over time, every emotion will pass away. At that time, we can return to our anchor. We can return to the breath. Continuing to stay present in your body. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. If we can learn to befriend our emotional life when we're not at war with ourselves, with our inner world, we can show up more fully and more compassionately for others. May the beneficial energy of our practice here together benefit all beings everywhere, so they may be happy, healthy, safe, and free from suffering. Thank you.
