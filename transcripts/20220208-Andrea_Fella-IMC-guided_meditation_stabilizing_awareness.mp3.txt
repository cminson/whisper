 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Our practice of attending to our experience, there are different reasons why we might do that. We might do it just to get a little bit of peace or quiet, to seclude ourselves for a while from the busyness of our day. And that's a fine reason to do it. It can help us in the rest of our day to have that time to let our mind settle. And also with this practice of mindfulness, of looking at our experience moment to moment, as the mindfulness stabilizes, there can be a power to that stability of mindfulness that lets us, if we're interested, if we kind of incline towards seeing, looking at understanding the deeper nature of our experience and how we tend to get caught. We resist the impermanent nature of experience. We resist the unreliable nature of experience. We want things to be steady, stable. We want to be able to hold on to something. And so this cultivation, interestingly, that we cultivate a stability of attention to see into the instability of experience. And so our practice is really to cultivate that stability, cultivate a stability of attention either through attending to one experience, just attending to the breath, for instance, letting the mind settle on one particular experience and cultivating a continuity of mindfulness that way. Or we might incline towards just a simple recognition moment to moment. There's awareness, and awareness is aware of this, aware of the next thing, the next thing, a kind of a changing flow of experience moment to moment. That will stabilize, that kind of connection with awareness will stabilize the awareness. Create a kind of concentration to be able to see the nature of experience and the nature of how our minds get caught by resisting the way things are. So our practice actually is relatively simple. We turn our attention to what's here now, this capacity we have to meet to be with the present moment. And that capacity is really supported by relaxation. So that's a great place to start in terms of cultivating the stability, allowing the body to relax. Maybe consciously scanning through the body and seeing if there are areas of tension and seeing if there can be a softening. So maybe the head, the face can relax. I often find relaxing the face is a good place to begin because there's such a connection between the face and our state of mind. So if we can relax our face and the head, you might notice that there's a kind of also a softening, not only of the muscles of the face, but also of the mind. The relaxing, the releasing of tension more internally. So maybe the head, the face can relax. Continuing the neck, the shoulders, maybe they too can soften and relax. Arms, hands. And checking in around the chest and upper back, maybe the muscles around the rib cage can soften. Sometimes I find a deeper breath at this point helps that area relax, allowing and expanding a stretching of all of those muscles and softening on the exhale. Maybe the stomach, the muscles across the stomach, the abdomen can soften. We often hold kind of subconsciously some tension in that area. Sometimes you can let it hang forward a little bit. We kind of hold that area in to hold ourselves up, but actually our skeleton, the structure of our bones, can really support us. We don't need to hold our muscles as much as we think we do. Maybe the middle and the lower back can relax. The hips, the legs, the feet. And then perhaps too there can be a softening inside the body, maybe the inside of the throat can relax. Maybe the heart can relax. Maybe the stomach and the intestines can relax. And maybe too there can be a softening or relaxation of mind, a relaxation of worries, concerns, a setting aside for now with the kind of the curiosity, the connection to what's happening right now, what's actually here and now. And as the body and mind relax very naturally, that's what our system seems to do, to attune to what's here. And so what is happening right now? What's most obvious or available is some sensations in the body, perhaps the breath, perhaps a broader sense of body, the body sitting here, maybe particular stronger areas of sensation like contact points of the hips, or the feet, or the hands. Or maybe for some a sense of, you know, we could call energetic vibration through the body. Sometimes it can be strong, sometimes it can be quiet and subtle. Can there be a relaxed receiving, just allowing the awareness to do its natural work of receiving experience? That's what it does. We don't actually have to do that work. We can relax and be there while awareness does that. And be curious about what awareness connects with. For some it can be helpful to allow the attention to stay rest with one particular area of experience, maybe the sense of the whole body or the breath. If that feels easeful, relaxed for you, that's fine. And for some it can feel more easeful not to try to hold the attention with one experience, but to open and allow the attention to receive whatever the attention is connecting with, maybe changing moment to moment. Maybe moving from one body's sensation to another. May at times be drawn to the experience of hearing or to the experience of an emotion that might be present. Or thoughts even. Might sometimes be drawn to a very clear, specific sensation. Or might sometimes be connecting with a broader sense, a broader experience, the kind of the felt sense of the whole experience right now. All that is happening. Whether the attention connects and rests with one experience or the awareness rests and receives changing experience. It's helpful to recognize when the attention begins to get a little wobbly, to lose touch with the present moment. Sometimes that might be felt as a little bit of a drifty experience. Or a kind of a sense of not really connected to what's happening. And perhaps sometimes we can connect to, oh, drifty experience is happening and that's enough actually to bring us right back in with this stabilizing the awareness on what's happening. And sometimes it can be useful to connect more clearly to some experience. To remind yourself what the experience of being present with an object is. Our practice is to cultivate this stability moment after moment, aware of what's here. And of course at some time you'll notice, you'll recognize that the mind has just fully gotten lost. And then there's the recognizing, we usually recognize that when mindfulness returns and we know that we haven't been connected to mindfulness for the little while before that. The moment of recognition is already a moment of awareness. We're aware again. And the relationship to that moment, how we are as mindfulness returns, is really key to this cultivation of our stability of awareness. Can we be interested in what's here now as opposed to being frustrated with ourselves that we weren't here a few moments ago? Those few moments ago, they're gone. Can we connect again with this moment? What's here right now? And it can be helpful in that moment if you notice what's here right now is that there's been some tension that's crept in during the mind wandering. It's fine to reconnect or re-establish a relaxed field in which we explore experience. So maybe taking some time to relax the body again. There's not a need to rush back to a particular experience such as the breath or to try to rush back to somehow being where we were before the mindfulness got lost. Aware again, relax, and then receive. Receiving moment after moment, cultivating that stability. Stability one moment at a time. Just enough effort to meet this moment. This body sensation, this sound, this half of a breath. And then the next moment, just enough effort to meet the next experience. The light touch of connecting with awareness and what we're aware of.
