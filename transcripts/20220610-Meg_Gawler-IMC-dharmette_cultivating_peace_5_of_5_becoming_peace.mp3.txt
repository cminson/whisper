Greetings everyone. It's a pleasure to be here with you all. Today is the last in
our series this week on Cultivating Peace. In the early texts of the Buddhist
teachings there are many synonyms for nibbana, complete awakening. One of which
is the Supreme Peace. Another is the Unconditioned. So I'll read to you
something from the Samyuta Nikaya 43.1. The Buddha says to his disciples,
I will teach you the Unconditioned and the path leading to the Unconditioned.
What is the Unconditioned? The destruction of greed, the destruction of
hatred, the destruction of delusion. This is called the Unconditioned. And what is
the path leading to the Unconditioned? Mindfulness directed to the body. This is
the path leading to the Unconditioned. So with complete awakening, the poisons of
greed, hatred and delusion are completely eradicated, never to return. And then the
Buddha says that the essence of the path leading to the Supreme Peace of the
Unconditioned is mindfulness of the body. As we've seen Samadhi or unification is
the last of the preparatory conditions from which the insights necessary for
liberation arise. When the meditator didn't dwell in Samadhi, the insights
leading to awakening were gradually and spontaneously unfold. And in all of the
wholesome states that we find in Buddhist teachings, each one can arise in a
wide spectrum of depth or intensity. And that entire spectrum is valuable,
including the first baby steps. Samadhi, for example, encompasses a range of
increasingly profound states of meditative absorption. And before
entering into Samadhi proper, there can be access to Samadhi when all five
hindrances are in abeyance and the mind is settled. For most practitioners it's
unlikely to be accessible in a 30 minute meditation or a weekday. And a silent
retreat offers the ideal conditions for cultivating Samadhi. That said, we may
have tastes of Samadhi outside of a retreat sentient. When the mind is at
peace, unified, and these small tastes are valuable and should be savored, they
give us an idea of what is in store. So for Samadhi to arise, we put in place the
condition of peaceful contentment. The body and mind are suffused with a sense
of well-being, which is calmer and more satisfying than joy. So let's briefly
review the steps along the path of liberative dependent arising, which put
in place the conditions for entering into the sacred state of Samadhi. It all
begins with an honest confrontation with our suffering. We live in a world of
ten thousand joys and ten thousand sorrows, which arise and pass away, and we
need to know our suffering in order to start the process of becoming free. And
then it's important that we have confidence in the path we've chosen to
follow. The stronger our confidence in the path, the greater our resolve can be.
Then with confidence that we're on the right track, gladness naturally arises.
We see it that indeed, there's a light at the end of our tunnel of darkness. The
next step is joy, which is directly proportional to how absorbed we are in
our practice. When awareness is strong, we feel the joy of being fully present,
the miracle of each moment. And these first steps of confidence, gladness, and
joy have a very useful function of dispelling anxiety and agitation. They
put in place the conditions for tranquility. When tranquility becomes
pervasive, the conditions are in place for peaceful, calm, contentment to arise, the
gentle happiness of Sukha. We are at peace with the way things are, with a deep
feeling of well-being. With agitation dispelled through tranquility, the well
being of calm contentment allows the mind to become unified and samadhi. So
we're on this beautiful, gradual path, and it may be more gradual for some than
for others. It doesn't matter if we're a slow bloomer or a fast bloomer. We all
have our karma to untangle, our knots to untie, and this will take the time it
takes. We need to study how we get caught and to learn what works and doesn't
work for us on the path to freedom. The good news is that no matter where we are
in the path, there are always opportunities for meeting or suffering
skillfully. And in that encounter, if we are mindful, we will see the folks in
the road that continually arise, and we can choose the peaceful road that leads
to freedom. If we're not mindful, chances are we'll be caught in reactivity. And
without even seeing the fork, we hurdle on down the samsaric path of dukkha. It's
also good news that as our practice develops, we do get better and better at
recognizing the forks in the road and choosing the wholesome one over the
unwholesome. We learn that we don't need to be at war with ourselves or at war
with the way things are. In any situation, we can choose peace. Obviously, I'm not
saying that we shouldn't defend ourselves if we're attacked, but I am saying
that blind reactivity is our enemy on this path. As our mindfulness becomes
strong and we begin to live in the practice of mindfulness, more and more
we choose the path of peace. One of the most powerful things I learned from my
root teacher, Suzuki Roshi, was that he taught the Dharma most powerfully by his
example. He radiated it, the Buddhist teachings. And that's something that we
can do too. So in the context of what we've been exploring this week, we can
incline our minds to the supreme safety, the supreme peace. Through our practice,
we cultivate joy, tranquility, the well-being of contentment, and unification.
And we can share these beautiful fruits of practice with everyone we come into
contact with. So the invitation is to live in peace to the extent we're able to.
We can begin to contribute to peace in the world by cultivating peace in
ourselves. If aversive thoughts arise, we look for peaceful thoughts. We try to
ensure that our speech is peaceful, our actions peaceful. And through our
practice, little by little, with the help of sati, lucid awareness, we can be
peaceful.
In everything we do, we offer peace to ourselves, and to everyone, to all beings.
And we can make the aspiration to be a safe haven of peace for all beings
everywhere.
Thank you for your practice.
