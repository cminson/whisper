 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioDharma.org. So today I'll continue this theme about what is the Dharma. Dharma is a powerful word in Buddhism and it has many meanings. But when I study these teachings of the Buddha, I see that one of the primary ways in which it is used as a reference, what it refers to, not maybe what it means literally, but what it refers to is action, things or something dynamic. It doesn't refer to things that are static, especially when the word dharma is used in the plural. In the singular sometimes it means teaching, and the Buddha's teachings for example. But in the plural, when it refers to dharma, it often refers to action, something that's active and dynamic. And this goes along with what I taught yesterday, that one of the meanings of dharma, or what it refers to, is the relatedness of all things, that things exist in relationship to other things, that come about in relationship to other things. And this relatedness is only related because there's a dynamic relationship between them. There are some ways in which the functioning of one thing impacts the other thing that goes on. And so things that live in relationship to each other because they're dynamic, they're more activities than they are things. There's more verbs than there are nouns in how Buddhism kind of focuses on the dharma. And so one of the clear places that I'm inspired to see this is the Buddha, near the end of his life, talked about, gave the instructions to take the dharma as your refuge, as your only refuge, as your island, as your support, as your refuge. And then he went on to say, take yourself as your refuge, as your only refuge. And saying these right next to each other, one after the other, take the dharma as the refuge and take yourself as your refuge, kind of implies a kind of equivalence between those. They're kind of like referring to the same thing seemingly, especially when he says, and no other refuge. Well then, the only works of the two are the same, dharma and yourself. And how could that be? Well then he goes on to say, and how do we do this? By practicing the four foundations of mindfulness, by practicing mindfulness of the body, mindfulness of feelings, mindfulness of mind states, mindfulness of the dharmas here, the fourth foundation of mindfulness. And this fourth foundation of mindfulness is referred to as dharmas, that's referring all to things which are dynamic, that are active. Many of them are mental actions, mental activities we're doing. The hindrances, for example. And those are all actions of the mind, activities of the mind, the seven factors of awakening. Things like mindfulness and investigation of dharmas, effort and joy and tranquility, concentration, equanimity. These are all functionings of the mind, so they're not dynamic. And generally when dharma is referred to activity, it generally refers to healthy, good activities, good conduct. Whether it's things we actually do, conduct that we engage in, or whether it's the activities of the mind that we wouldn't necessarily call them actions, if actions are limited to a person who does something, but they're the functionings of the mind. And so when there's emphasis on all things are changing, inconstant, impermanent, you see that, yes, of course, that's what we're pointing to when we're pointing to the inconstancy of things. Not that they necessarily come to an end, which is certainly part of it, but that as they are, they're dynamic, appearing and disappearing. Kind of like waves that come and go and come and go. There's these activities that are not fixed, not static. We're not stuck. And so this idea that dharmas in the teachings of the Buddha repeatedly refers to something which is dynamic and active and activity, is actually kind of the good news of Buddhism because it means that when nothing is frozen in place, it's kind of like there's no hardware operating here. It's all software. And we can change the software. The conditions can change, the choices we make can change. And so because it's all in relatedness, all the actions we do relate to each other, certain kinds of activities that are unwholesome, unhealthy, the way that they relate to what follows is unhealthy. Greed and hatred has a negative impact. Generosity and love has a very different impact. Mindfulness is an activity of the mind, even though it might feel sometimes just being aware is mostly a not a doing. And it feels so restful not to do, just to be aware, for resting in awareness. Even so, awareness is a firing of certain nerves in the brain. It is a certain activity that's going on. But it's not something that the self feels like it's doing. And it's such a relief to feel like something's beautiful thing is flowing, but that we're not the one who's doing it. So when we do mindfulness, what we're doing is bringing in conditions that allows things to settle, bringing in the conditions that allow us to see clearly what's happening, bringing in conditions that allows us to differentiate between the different kind of mental activities that are going on so that we do the ones that are healthiest for us, the ones that are the right effort, that's been teaching from last week. Another place we see this Buddha emphasizing this idea of Dharma being activities is in this teachings of the seven factors of awakening. There's a teaching called, the second one is usually called an English investigation. But the ancient word has the word Dhamma, Dharma in it. And it's Dhamma Vichaya. Vichaya means to distinguish or differentiate. It's the differentiation of Dhammas. When the Buddha explains what it's differentiating, it's mental activities, the seven factors of awakening again, the Eightfold Path, the Four Noble Truths, the Five Faculties, the Four Right Efforts, that the mind has the ability to distinguish between what is healthy and not healthy as activities of the mind, as what's wholesome and not wholesome. And this is the ability to see clearly in the mind the activities of the mind, what's happening in the mind is part of the gift of being very settled and present and quiet, almost like we're not doing anything. And then we start seeing much more clearly what's happening there, the activities. Oh, my mind's going down the lot, going down that old well dug canal of wanting, of desiring. And I've seen that that doesn't take me in a good direction. I don't have to do that anymore. I can take the vitality of my mental energy, of awareness and let it flow someplace else, recognize what's happening and not get caught in it. I could focus on something else instead. I can focus on contentment. That feels healthy when I do contentment, then I settle more. So there's this gentle kind of action that goes on in this practice, which I referred back to last week, right effort. Right effort is an action. And we're learning how to act, how to do, so it borders on, or some people would see it as almost like I'm not doing. It's so peaceful. It's so relaxed. It's so flowing. Maybe it's like flowing water. We don't see that's flowing because it's so clear. There is an activity, an onward leading, a flow to what's awakening through this practice. So the dharma, meaning activity, dynamism, action, it means engaging. And so this is also kind of a paradigm shift for some people, just like focusing on relatedness is a paradigm shift as opposed to focusing on me and you, focusing on the relationships. So the same way, rather than focusing on nouns, on things are fixed, this is how it is, I'll always be this way. It'll always be this way. The situation will always be this way. Is to start being attuned to where the activity is, where the flow is, where the dynamism is, where the change is happening. It's always happening anyway. So to be attuned to that, to surf with it, to flow in it, to participate in it. And if we're flowing in a river, and the current is taking us against dangerous rapids, then we learn how to swim over to the other side of the river where the water is long peacefully. We learn the terrain, we learn the route, we learn how to use the flow of change, but it's always changing. So what I suggest that you do today is, if you're interested in an assignment, is to become a little bit more, or quite a bit if you can, aware of how you freeze, how you stop in the river of change, river of time, how you get preoccupied by things or fixated. Flowing doesn't mean you don't have to focus on certain things, but then we focus on them with a flow, with the mind itself shifting and changing and flowing. The mind doesn't freeze. The mind doesn't get caught, but is involved in a flowing, gentle way. Where we are like unsui, we're like clouds and water, the Japanese word, that flows with the flow of life, flow of time, that flows with the movements and activities of the mind, choosing what's heavenly. So the dharma, very important, if it's not the literal meaning, it's often what's being pointed to, it's pointing to action, to activity, to dynamism. And that's where it's in dynamism, in activity, in action, that the dharma is found more than assuming that it's only in stillness, only in peace or quiet or some fixed state. Nothing fixed. Always changing, always flowing. So I hope you can see the difference between being stopped, stuck, and gentle flowing along with all things, even if you're sitting quietly still in meditation and your body's not moving, everything is still flowing. So thank you very much, and we'll continue this tomorrow.
