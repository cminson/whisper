 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at adiodarma.org. So this will be the last talk on this fifth exercise of the Satipatthana Sutta, the exercise on mindfulness of the elements, or what I like to call as mindfulness of the properties, the earth property, the water property, the fire property, and the air property. And this is a meditation, mindfulness of sensations. So the basic sensory awareness exercise of just being present for the sensations that are direct and immediate as they occur for ourselves. And there's a variety of ways of practicing this. And one of the ways, this is the way we did in the meditation today, which some people find easier than meditating on their breath. And that is to just be grounded in the sensations of the body. If the mind wanders off, come back to the body in the flow of sensations with the attention, not particularly, not any more directed to the body than it is to the whole body, just there rooted in the body, and then floating and roaming around, touching into the present moment with the different sensations as they flow through and come into being. Some people find that the breathing actually works as a better anchor to the present. If they stay there, they can develop their stability, their concentration, and their mindfulness. And there also it's a sensation meditation. It's the same meditation, but now we're doing the being aware of all the sensations that come into play as we breathe. So technically, this four elements meditation is what we're doing in Vipassana when we're tuning into the breathing. Now the attention though, is in a much narrower, smaller area of our body, just an area where the breathing occurs or where the breathing is predominant. And so we are there with the flow of sensations. And we let maybe the attention kind of float within the location where we're focusing on the breathing and letting the sensations come into that floating awareness or let the floating awareness settle and the ripple of sensations that come into play. As we get quieter and quieter and the breathing gets still and quieter, it's easier to kind of just stay with the simple sensations that come and go as we breathe. It's still a sensation meditation, still this four element meditation that we're doing. But because it's more rooted in a particular place, some people find it's easier, the mind doesn't wander off as much and it's easier to settle in simpler that way. And as I said, some people find it's simpler to do the whole body. Some people, what we do is sometimes in mindfulness is we, what I like to teach is we are rooted in the breathing. That's kind of like the default, that's the place where we cultivate stability and steadiness of mind to stay in the present moment. But if some other sensation arises in the body that's more compelling, then we contentedly, relaxedly let the attention float to that other place and then begin doing the sensation meditation in that place, in the knees or the back or whatever the sensations might be strong. And there too it is not to fixate the attention, but rather to let it roam around, let it come like you're touching a cave wall in the dark and you can't see it, but you just let your hand go around and feel the wall and the texture, the temperature, whatever it might be. But the direction that it's going with this kind of sensation meditation is the same direction as all the different exercises of satipatthana. And that is to be able to steady, stable enough in the present moment, the mind is not wandering off anymore, we're right here in the present moment and then we're just feeling the experience and because the mind is now stable and not wandering off easily, then we can settle back and just observe the experience. And this idea of observing the experience is meant to be a peaceful experience that we're not interfering or making a lot of work, it's very receptive, allowing, just observing as the flow of sensations, the experience as it comes through. And in particular, as we settle back and there's more and more stability in the present moment, we're just right in the present moment, then we see that in the present moment, everything is passing, everything is moving. I don't know if it's a good analogy, but if you take an old film that's made up of all these little squares and you have it pass by, you have a little slot and you have each frame come in front of the slot, then another one comes in front of the slot and if you just settle back and watch, then you see that there's just a lot, if one comes, one comes, one comes and you see they come and they go, they come and they go. So in some kind of relaxed flowing way, we start seeing more and more things just come and go and come and go. And this opens up to deeper places than now letting go of not clinging. So that's the direction we're going. But how do we get there? One way in the tradition is if you look at the analogy or the simile that's used for this particular exercise. I think the simile is we do the four element meditation, being aware of the sensations in these four categories. And it's like a, so I'm sorry for this little graphic, but a butcher who has cut up a cow and put out the different pieces of the cow for people to maybe come and buy or something. And at this point, people are not relating to the pieces of meat as the cow, it's just pieces of meat. And they see the pieces of meat independent of the cow. So I think maybe it's unfortunate for many of us this graphic kind of analogy, but the idea is that we often are living in thoughts and ideas that we take in our whole self, like how we identify ourselves in a particular way. Some of the identities are accurate enough, but if we live in the whole, the identity, then we miss the parts. And this is a meditation to not be in the idea of the whole, but rather to begin tuning into the particular elements, parts that make up the whole or that we apply the concepts of our ideas to. And so for example, if I was to think I'm a lousy person, that's a generalization of the whole. If I then feel the sensations in my hand, the sensations themselves are just sensations. And there's no lousiness in the hands, in those sensations. If I think I'm a great person, that's a generalization. If I think I'm a lousy person, whatever it is. And the idea is to kind of have an experience of ourselves where we drop below the coarser identities, the coarser ideas of who we are, because often those ideas are sources of suffering. And even if they're sources of happiness, they can also be, they limit us to drop into this deeper, settled, relaxed, observing place, observing the present moment as it flows by. So by beginning to look at the sensation level of experience, we're looking at the parts in a sense of the cow, not the cow as a whole. We're looking at the parts of ourselves, not the generalizations of what we have, of who we are. And so we're dropping down to a deeper level. And this can be quite healing, quite healthy to do this, because some of the ideas and attachments to the ideas that we have involve contractions and tightness. And they involve a disconnect with our lived, flowing bodily experience. And to be able to drop down into the lived bodily experience and let that flow, the sensations flow and move and not be bottled up, not be restricted, not be contracted, is really healthy, spiritually really healthy. Just a healthy thing, mentally, to be in this kind of flow of sensations where the mind is not fixated on its painful ideas or whatever ideas it has. So this idea of dropping down into the parts, into the direct experience of what's actually happening more than the ideas and thoughts about things is part of what this exercise is about. What it helps us to do is to bring the mind and body together in harmony. If the mind is thinking about tomorrow or yesterday, thinking about fantasies, delusions of grandeur, delusions of poor me or something, we tend to be disconnected from our bodies. And the body is always in the present moment. And so the task of meditation is to, when we want to harmonize the body and mind, is to let the mind join where the body is. And since the body has a lot to do with sensations, that's where we can find the harmony, that's where you can find the meeting, the joining, better than if we just stay conceptually thinking about how wonderful the body is and celebrating the body with ideas within the sensation level of experience. And that's where this harmony happens, is coming together. And this we'll see as we move on in the Satyapatana Sutta, becomes really helpful to connect to deeper dimensions of our heart, deeper dimensions of our inner life. So we'll get there. But tomorrow we'll start doing a few sessions on the sixth exercise of Satyapatana. And I want to, maybe I should warn you, that this involves contemplation, maybe even visualization of corpse. And I'm not going to make it graphic, but it'll be kind of very simple. But this is the exercise. There's actually nine different contemplations on the progressive decay of a corpse. And I don't think it's meant to be gruesome, but it's meant to somehow in its own way, help us maybe value the present moment and really show up here in the present moment so that there's a qualitatively improved aliveness to our attention and dedication to this present moment experience. So hopefully this will be supportive for you to spend a couple of days on this corpse contemplation. It's a long tradition in Buddhism to contemplate death. And so we'll do that for a few days as part of this Satyapatana Sutta. Thank you.
