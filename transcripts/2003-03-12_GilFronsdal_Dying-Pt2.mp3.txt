 So, I'm feeling that it's kind of an intimate thing to talk about death and dying. And I'm also feeling that, especially those of you sitting in chairs, feel very far away. And I wonder if we could harmonize these two things by having people come sit closer so I can feel more closely connected as I... Let me just for my sake. Thank you. In Zen monasteries, they have this wooden plaque, this wooden block that is used for calling people to the meditation hall. And maybe some of you have heard it, you've been to Zen centers, and it sounds something like this. And so, that sound then hits quite hard and resounds through the monastery. And on that wooden plaque is usually written something to the effect of something like, life and death are the great matter. Practice as if your hair's on fire. Don't waste time. And so, every hit to that hand, that block, that's what's being kind of sent out. Don't waste time. Life and death is the great matter. And it can be said, I think very directly, that the central trust of Buddhism is to come to terms with this great matter of life and death, to resolve it, deal with it. And so, that this is essential issues of who we are as human beings, and facing our mortality, is it really one of the central aspects of the whole Buddhist enterprise? Many people I know come to Buddhism for more personal reasons. They're kind of dealing with their own suffering in a very personal way, trying to find personal ways of coping better with life, which is all very fine. But Buddhism itself is meant to be this great confrontation with this issue. And in that spirit, it's been said, it can be said, that all Buddhist practice is a preparation for dying. All Buddhist practice is meant to bring us to this point of dealing with these deep existential questions of life and death within permanence. And to do that with hopefully in a spirit of love and compassion and peace, and the image of the Buddha dying is a very powerful one for Buddhists, because he was someone who died at peace, fairly consciously, consciously, I suppose, but laid himself quietly down. And entered into meditative states, and then in this meditative state, quietly passed away. The Buddha did not say, the Buddha offered and suggested, and down through the ages, Buddhists have suggested, that it's very helpful to do practices reflecting on death. I talked about this last week. And there's a whole series of different ways of reflecting on death and practicing on it. And you can be creative in your own ways in thinking about it and reflecting on it. But the Buddha had very little to say, or didn't say anything as far as we know, there's no record of it, about what lay people, ordinary monks even, monks and nuns, how they should die in terms of the processes, the rituals, the customs, what to do with the body, what to do afterwards, the funeral, memorial service, how to treat all these things. He didn't talk about that very much. And so what happens in the history of Buddhism is that as Buddhists must travel to different cultures, Buddhism has tended to adopt their local customs for how to handle this process of dying in terms of what to do with the body and the funerals, memorial service, things like that, the rituals and rites. And Buddhism has been quite flexible in that way. And so you find actually great diversity in the Buddhist traditions about how they handle the whole death process and after death. However, what's probably enduring throughout all these Buddhist traditions, so this way, that what's often sometimes been said then is that in any given culture, you do that which is most helpful at the time of death and with the whole dying process. So in different cultures, different things are helpful for people, partly because of different customs and partly because maybe different worldviews that people carry about themselves and the world around them. But the one thing that's probably most enduring through all the different Buddhist traditions is the idea of offering the idea of what is most helpful, what's the greatest help for you as a person, you or go through your dying or after death for the people who survive. What is most helpful? And what Buddhists suggest is that what's most helpful is to look at the dying process and death as a spiritual process and as an opportunity to deepen one's spiritual life, to find the possibility of awakening in that process, to find how to come at peace with our clingings, our attachments, our fears, to find the capacity for love and compassion at those times. And so in adopting with local customs for that which is most helpful, Buddhism will keep in mind what is helpful for my Buddhist practice, for these purposes of what I've been practicing for, the direction the practice is going. So all Buddhist practice can be seen as preparations for death and certain practices then become particularly important as a person gets close to death. For a Buddhist practitioner to know that they're going to die, and we all know, but to really kind of turn the corner, which sometimes is in the mind, to really know that now you come to the end. There's no more, you have an illness and a doctor has told you there's no cure anymore and you're kind of, death is going to inevitably become, sometimes you're given a time frame. You have, you know, a doctor will say maybe you have two weeks to two months or two months to a year or something. And then even then you might say, well, you don't really believe it, but then finally you're in the hospital, you know, and they say, you know, maybe you should think about, you know, what your choices are if your heart stops, what would you like to do then? So it comes to a point where it's really obvious that this is what's happening, this is the track that's really going to happen. At some point when you really see it coming, see it approaching, then for a Buddhist practitioner this becomes an extremely important time to devote to their Buddhist practice, to do their Buddhist practice, to use it, to call on it. And I would encourage people to spend time, more time on the spiritual practice, on the meditation practice during this time, to make sure there's time for that, to spend quiet time, contemplative time, doing the practice you usually are doing, doing other kinds of practices that seem appropriate for the time, finding a spiritual counselor, finding a Buddhist teacher to talk to and get guidance, finding having other Sangha friends that can come and practice with you, come and have discussions with you about your understanding about life and death and about Buddhism, come and just spend quiet time with you. Anything at all you can do that somehow enhances that as a spirit, as a quality time for your spiritual life. It can not always, not always easy to do that because sometimes, you know, fear arises, sometimes busyness arises. I once did an exercise for some people about imagine, imagine if you're going to die in 12 hours. What would that be like if you knew that you're 12 hours? And then I said, okay, let go of that. Now imagine you're going to die in four hours. What does that bring up? And then imagine you're going to die in an hour and then 10 minutes and then in a minute and then what if it's just now? I've done that a few times for people and worked different kind of workshops. Once I did that and it was so powerful for a woman that she decided to retire from her job after that exercise because she felt, you know, what am I doing working? There's more important things to do. And she'd been so happy ever since. It was one of the best decisions she had ever made. But it came from that little exercise of really facing, you know, what if this was the last day or something of her life? But I remember there was another woman who said that as we went back through, you know, through shorter and shorter time and there was when she reached one hour, then she realized that she was the retreat center was more than an hour away from her house. So she could no longer rush back home and clean up and make order and take care of all the kind of details of daily life that somehow she felt she had to do. And she felt this great relief because she had to give up all these busyness that she thought she had to do to kind of settle her affairs. There was no chance of doing it because she couldn't, you know, it was only an hour left and it was more than an hour's drive. So this idea of being busy, some people suddenly feel like they have to get busy and do a lot and maybe take care of other people. But to emphasize that this is a very important time and to find some, to make the time, to make the effort to use one's practice at this time is very important. So there's certainly, and a lot of the practices that hopefully you're familiar with come to play at this time for spiritual preparation, for spiritual practice. There are, one of the useful things is to practice forgiveness, is to look at your relationships that you have and see if there's any unfinished business. And certainly it's good, it makes good sense, it's helpful for everybody concerned. It's certainly a gift we give other people to clarify those relationships where we have a chance. It can be hard for people to survive you and to feel the ambivalence or the difficulty or the pain. Oh, that relationship was never clarified. But it can also be, it's also very important for the dying process itself that as you get into those last days, last minutes, if that's what happens to you, that your mind is not still holding on to what if or could I or I need to or I'm not going to, not for that person, I'm not going to forgive that person. And so the mind is holding on to something. And if the dying process is going to happen, if it can happen, if it happens in a natural smooth way, which is no guarantee it's going to happen that way. If the mind is holding on to something, it makes the dying process more difficult. So anything you can do to help loosen up the attachments in the mind prior to dying is helpful. And it's helpful for living also. And so if you have, if you still have unresolved relationships that entail some kind of holding, you're holding your heart, you have resentment, for example, which is kind of holding, it's very helpful for you at that point to be able to release that in whatever way you can. And hopefully it's done in relationship with a person, if you can't talk with them, deal with it. If you can't deal with it directly, maybe there's more personal private ways you can do it, but somehow come to terms with those things and don't carry those with you to the very end. So the practice of forgiveness, which is not necessarily an easy thing to do. Again, you can try to get help with that. And I've gone and counseled people who are dying and kind of learned very close to their death and was surprised that to be pulled into the role of being a marital counselor. I kind of hadn't the first time that happened, I was there to counsel a person, I thought the person was dying within a few days and it's momentous time for their life. And I was surprised that they wanted to talk about marriage problems. But actually that's what needed to happen. Some people might interpret it as saying, well, this person was holding out until those problems could be resolved before they could actually die. And some people have the sense, I don't know if it's true or not, have the sense of people hold out because things are unresolved and they're holding on or hoping to get them resolved. So sometimes getting help for that. It's certainly a time to work on your relationship with yourself. Yes. I found Steven Levine's book enormously helpful in that life review and to do it now. It's just one of the most worthwhile things I've ever done. Great. Which one? Who dies or one year to live? Which book? A year to live. Yeah. And there are people who form year long support groups. A friend of mine who does, a couple of people I know doing it. And so to review your life and look at what's unfinished. But it's also then to look at your relationship to yourself. And some people put that on hold. Some people never really deal with that in a deep way. And sometimes, as many of you might know, the whole realms of who we are, that we don't really face until we do something as powerful as going to retreat. And we kind of happily go along as if it's not there. And then on retreat, it hits us in the face. And wow, I didn't know that was there for me. The dying process is kind of like if it's happened slowly enough, the ultimate retreat. And so to look at your relationship to yourself and to realize that's part of the process. You know, many people have many different attitudes towards how to relate to each other when people are dying. Some people want to make everything peaceful and nice and ignore how they're really feeling. If they're really afraid or if they're grieving or if they're angry or whatever. For the sake of the person who's dying, for the sake of the people who are surviving, you don't want to really show them how what's going on. My own bias or my own understanding along this regard is that just like in everywhere else in life, that the honesty, the honest confrontation, the honest bringing up what's within us, the practice of mindfulness of those things is part of the process for everybody concerned. And then rather than holding back and hiding something, I have great faith that if the people are practicing or have some sense of how to work a process of mindfulness, of honesty, that the best thing to do is for everyone concerned to be really honest about what's really going on for them. If you're really afraid for someone who's dying or really upset about it, really distressed about it, find some way, you might have to be a little bit careful how you say it, but have some way to share that with a person so that they can be a process. A greater intimacy can happen then if it's done in the right way, careful way. If you're unsure how to do that, how to share those difficult parts of yourself with someone else, then again pull in some kind of friend, a counselor or a teacher or someone, maybe can share you to work with those kinds of issues. But I have a great faith that whatever arises in the context of dying, whatever the feelings or thoughts, whatever arises is all part of that process of dying and it's all to be included as part of the practice at that time. Nothing is outside of that process of practice at that time. So don't feel like you have to inhibit or censor anything that's going on, though you might have to do things in a wise way, kindly if you can. So the nature of a spiritual practice during the dying period of someone's life varies a lot, the kind of practice a person does varies a lot depending on the stage of dying they're in. Some people are still relatively strong and robust when they know they're dying and perhaps they can do more active intentional practices. They can practice, they can, it's great to cultivate your concentration. I've heard great stories in Thailand, they love telling stories like this in Burma and Thailand about people who die and kind of the practices they do and remember one person, I think one of the Ajahn Chah's books is dedicated to her, but she came to see Ajahn Chah just before, you know, when she knew she was dying of cancer and he taught her how to concentrate on the breath. I think to concentrate on the breath and to say that the mantra buddho as she was doing it and she was able to get very concentrated, she cultivated and developed a concentration where she still could and having a strength of mind of a concentrated mind is very helpful in the dying process, partly because if you're concentrated your mind is strong, it's much less likely to be caught up in the reactivity, caught up in its fears. It might still happen, but you might not be caught up in it. It's a lot easier to be in a peaceful frame of mind if you have the ability to be concentrated and calm. So if you still have the ability, then that's what you focus on. Maybe you focus on doing loving kindness practice, cultivating that ability, developing that ability to do loving kindness, practicing forgiveness, practicing developing mindfulness. If you have a chance, go on a retreat. There are people who come on retreats that I teach that they show up and they say, well, you know, I'm dying. That's why I'm here. And so, you know, that's what they're trying to do and it's beautiful. It's really one of the great things to do if you have enough time and the ability to do that. So, but then there are times when we're dying and other times, there are times perhaps when we're quite weak and bedridden and don't have a lot of strength, maybe not even mental strength to kind of engage in kind of a focused practice. And then perhaps the primary practice a person might do is a practice of letting go or surrendering. And I just letting go or a non-doing practice. There are non-doing meditation practices like zazen is considered a non-doing practice or choiceless awareness practice can be considered a non-doing practice. You try to not do anything at all. Every time you notice the mind trying to do something, you let go of trying to do something and the mind is expert at trying to do things, right? And, but if you can't do anything, you don't have the energy to do a lot of things, the non-doing practice can be actually be very, very helpful and very easy because you can feel that how tired it makes you to make the effort. And so to know that that's actually it's a valuable practice to let go of all the doing, especially if you had a background in practice of doing that in regular life, then you can trust how significant it is to keep letting go, keep letting go of all your efforting, all you're doing, trying to do anything at all. The Buddhist goal, the goal in Buddhism for the dying moment is to be as aware and conscious as you can. And this also seems to be the primary goal these days in the hospice movement, as best as I can tell. And the hospice movement has been a pioneer in this country in learning how to administer pain medications, non-narcotic medications and all kinds of other kind of non-pain medications that help with pain and kind of have the right recipe so that a person can stay as aware and conscious as they can, but still manage with their pain so they don't get go unconscious or get kind of drugged or something. And so the Buddhists put a great value on that. And I've been in hospital situations where I haven't done it personally, but other Buddhist teachers I've been with have, I had to have discussions with doctors that try to convince the doctors to try to keep, you know, use the least amount of pain medication, least amount of narcotics or morphine or whatever, because the doctor's tendency, but this was, I don't know what it is now, maybe things change quite a bit now, but I used to be, you know, go to the hospitals in the 80s when we had to have these discussions and because the doctors were ready to kind of crank it up, wanted to make the person as absolutely as unconscious as possible to be so they could be completely convinced that the person would not feel any distress or pain. For a Buddhist you want to, certainly it's valuable to medicate and try to keep the pain under control, but you want to, you know, ideally you would moderate yourself if you can. And if you can cope with the pain and deal with the pain, great. And if you had a meditation practice where you've dealt with pain and looked at pain and worked with pain a lot before, then perhaps you can stay much more clearly alert, use less medication, because you're more comfortable with pain than you would be if you hadn't practiced. It's very powerful. People sometimes, people ask on retreats, why should I sit with pain? You know, I can just stretch my leg out. Well, one, I don't usually say this, I don't think, but one of the reasons is that way maybe you know how to deal with pain when you come to the end of your life and you are in a lot of pain, you have painful death, and you've already dealt with pain to some degree, you know the territory, you know how your mind reacts, you know how to work with it, you know, the whole show. So the Buddhist goal is try to be as conscious and aware as possible. And to be in a wholesome state of mind, because the, for two reasons. One is the classic reason is that the state of your mind when you die, the moment of death, what you're thinking about the moment of your death has a great influence in how you get reborn. So you want to put yourself in as wholesome state as possible. So a lot of the preparation work of dying, especially in the last periods, is to prepare yourself to try and get yourself in the right state of mind. So whatever it takes to get yourself in a wholesome state of mind, to resolve the issues and all that. To do a kind of life review, as someone mentioned, but to do it kind of with looking for those parts of your life that bring you happiness and joy to remember. Your good deeds, your good qualities, good things you've done, your accomplishments that make you happy, people you've loved, people you've helped. And often I think some of you had this experience on retreats, we give this exercise to people. Think about something that, some good deed you did in your life that makes you happy. And inevitably someone will say, I can't think of one. And I doubt it's because they haven't done one, done any, but sometimes there's a big block that people have from that kind of deep self-appreciation that can be helpful to bring the mind to wholesome state of mind at the time of death. In Asia, in Southeast Asia, one of the ways that monks and people counsel the dying is it'll actually tell them about, oh, remember when you did that? Remember that? Remember that thing you did? As a way of kind of lifting up their mind, making it happy. So the idea is to be as aware as you can, have the mind as clear as possible, and to have the mind in a wholesome state. Now it happens to be that mindfulness itself, the practice of mindfulness, the mind that's practicing mindfulness, mindfulness is a wholesome state, wholesome activity of the mind. So some people will simply focus on doing mindfulness the best they can, as much as they can, in that dying process, because that also happens to be, you're doing two things at once. And then you certainly do a lot of other wholesome activities, like thinking about your good quality. Some people will reflect on their Buddha or remember their spiritual teachers, the statue of the Buddha or picture of their spiritual teachers or someone who brightens their mind spiritually in that kind of way. Presence, so that maybe there's one tradition in Buddhism where you have a painting or a picture at the foot of your bed, so you're actually looking at that while you're dying. So it kind of helps you stay in the best frame of mind. So you don't get anxious or distressed in the last minutes. The practice of loving kindness. I've never heard of this happening, but I can imagine that some people do it. I can imagine it could be a good idea that some people would practice loving kindness, rather than practicing mindfulness right up to the last moment, they would dedicate themselves to practicing loving kindness as much as they can right up to the last moment. That is a very powerful wholesome state to be in. And I imagine that it could be a very wonderful way to have to condition one's mind in the last moments. Some people in Southeast Asia, in the Theravana tradition, there's a lot of emphasis on the practice of generosity, both before you die and in your name after you die. And usually it's done towards monastics, but it's not always. Sometimes it's done for charity or for good causes. The classic reason for practicing generosity is to create merit. And the more good merit you have, the better your rebirth will be. The currency of merit, it usually doesn't have much holding power in the psyche of Westerners. It doesn't mean a lot for them, unless you kind of explain it in different ways, that merit has to do with the habits of mind that you're creating. And so if you do a lot of good things, you're creating wholesome habits of mind, which have certain momentum that help you out in the future. But the practice of generosity, besides creating merit, also is a way of gladdening the mind, bring happiness, bring peace. And some people would like, when they know they're going to die, to practice even more generosity than they usually would. They start giving away their things. Let me give you some things here. Take that home. You like that? Whatever. To do things, to actually know that make you happy. Some people will do it through their will. They're quite happy knowing what's going to happen to their estate. Wow, this is really great. I can just imagine what the ACLU is going to do with that money. This is really great and it makes you really happy. So that's kind of like spiritual preparation. Last week I talked about the kind of preparation, the kind of reflections on meditation, on death you can do when you know you're still healthy and not dying soon. And then there's a lot of things you can do while you're dying. And if you come to talk to me or come to talk to other teachers and we'll talk about those practices. And sometimes if you're dying and you're weak or semi-conscious, unconscious, sometimes it can be very helpful to have someone come along and guide you through some practices. Guided loving kindness meditation, a friend can do it, they can read passage, guide you in doing letting go practices. And so have this guided help in the practice. Sometimes as you know it can be hard to practice alone. And so sometimes even on your death bed it can be helpful to have fellow practitioners come and meditate with you. Just be in the room with you and meditate and maybe you give instructions that they shouldn't talk to you. You don't want any conversations, you can't deal with it. It might even be some Asanga people, you don't even like them particularly. You don't want whatever they're going to bring in terms of conversation. So you make sure that in a polite way it's clear that people are invited to come and sit with you. And people really like to do that. I think it's very helpful. It's a generous act, it's a supportive act. And just to know that someone's around you sitting and meditating can be a great support and help. If you can't practice yourself in some way at least it helps create the atmosphere and the mood that is very settling and helpful. Some people who are practitioners find it very helpful to have other practitioners come to meditate or to be around there because they tend to be much more calm in the face of death than other people might be. And so if you have relatives coming in or being around or doctors even or nurses who are anxious about this thing of death to have people who are comfortable and know how to practice know to be calm and peaceful is helpful for everyone concerned and that people have to run around kind of anxious. And I had once a doctor tell me, I was really surprised, but I was not a doctor, I was a nurse. She worked in a kind of intensive care ward where people came basically to die. So it was her work to be around dying people. And we would go and sit with this fellow who was dying. And he was, I think he was medicated so much that he, I don't know, he was pretty much unconscious, semi-conscious. So and I didn't know him, most of us didn't know him. We just had been a student at Zen Center in San Francisco and at some point in the distant past and he'd asked people to come and help him. It was a dying process and so we would take turns, we would have vigil there in 24 hours a day someone would be sitting with meditating in his room with him. And so I went once for a two-hour session meditating in his room. And as I was leaving, the nurse said to me, oh it's so helpful for us, for me, when your Buddhists come and meditate because it makes us so much calmer, you're so calm and accepting of it that it makes, helps us become more, be more peaceful with this situation also. So you know inviting people in can be very, very helpful and you know if you know that you're going to be incapacitated or expect to be in some ways, maybe telling your relatives who are in charge, maybe you aren't practitioners, that this is what you want ahead of time is very, very important. So there's a lot of kind of spiritual preparation can be done. There's also practical preparations for dying that can be done and it should be done. And I kind of think of the practical and the spiritual to be the same or not the same but to be, I don't see the practical preparations for dying to be separate from the spiritual preparation even though we can talk about them separately. That anything that helps you kind of look death directly in the face and to be honest about it and to help you, you know, helps you come to terms with it and use it to inform your life and teach you about impermanence. Then I think it's really helpful and so the planning ahead for your death and preparing for it is helpful for your own sake. It's also very helpful for the people that you leave behind, your family, your loved ones, your friends because it can be quite, you know, it's a big deal to have to make big decisions. You know if you haven't told people what you want then people have to decide themselves and they don't necessarily know and they kind of have to, you know, search their minds or they have to argue or, you know, one side of the family wants this, you know, side of family wants that and whatever, you know, it's kind of, it can be difficult. And so it's kind of, I think it's kind of a gift, it's kind of a generous thing to plan ahead so you don't burden the people who, the people are grieving anyway and that, you know, it's better, I would think it's better not to have to do a lot of these kind of big decisions and wondering what to do and what your wishes might be because they don't know. I think it's better they know and then they can kind of be with their own process more. I know some people prefer not to deal with their grief right away and they'd rather be, some people tell me they actually prefer to be busy doing a lot of things and all the things that have to happen. Some people get, you can be phenomenally busy, probably some of you knows, right? After someone dies and you're taking care of what's left, you can be so busy, you know, it's exhausting. You hardly even know what you think and feel because you're just, you know, taking care of so many relatives coming out of town and friends and this and that. So, you know, there are practical things to do and some of the, I'm sure a lot of you know these things and I want to just mention a few of them. There are, you know, great books on this topic that talk about all the different practical things and all kinds of things and I was hoping this kind of class would mostly focus on particular things that Buddhism had to offer, not kind of basic common sensical things that are available for people in general. But there are things that I think are very helpful to think about. There was a time in California where people made living wills and then also a durable power of attorney's document and my understanding now from reading what Kaiser gave me is that that has been changed in California. Now instead of those two documents there's something called the advanced health care directive and that health care directive combines the living will and the durable power of attorney in one document and offers more choices for you than the earlier kind of version said to provide it. But there's a lot of choices of decisions you need to make that you can make that are very helpful, especially when a situation where you can't express your own wishes. If you can express your own wishes then the doctors will listen to what you have to say but if you're unconscious or can't speak for some reason then to have some document that says what your wishes are and you have some persons in charge of making those decisions, helping those decisions through these documents is very very helpful. And I'm going to go through, list kind of just list some of the things that you might want to think about. Partly with the idea that for some of you it might be a surprise to realize how many things you might have to, someone who might have to decide about in the last days of someone's life. You might think oh anything is fine. There's a lot of interventions, medical interventions that you have some choice over and you might want to have some decide ahead of time. Do you want to be fed through artificially through feeding tubes? Do you want to get or through artificial you know do you want tubes down your throat or tubes in your stomach or whatever way as they do it? Do you want mechanical support for your breathing? Do you want CPR? And some people will you know very clearly say no CPR if the heart stops and sometimes they have you know they write that on the chart above the bed or something so the nurses know that oh okay they're not going to do anything massive here. How do you feel about blood transfusions and using other kind of blood products? Do you want dialysis if your kidney fails? Do you want antibiotics? And in what circumstances do you want these things? You know you could specify if there's some hope that you might survive and get well then please maintain it. Do these things. If you know there's no hope and you know you're dying then do you want some of them in order to maintain the quality of your life so there's kind of you can more gradual kind of more pleasant or more comfortable quality of life in the last moments as you die, last minutes or days. Or do you just want to let nature take its course and just not have any interventions at all? Do you want to be you want any life support treatment at all? In what circumstances would you want such treatment? What do you do if you're in a coma and you're not expected to wake up or recover from the coma? Do you have wishes around that? Do you say it's been a few months now or a certain length of time and no one expects you to ever recover? I mean there are occasionally people who recover after many years stories have been known to happen but the doctors basically think you're in a coma maybe have brain damage. You're not going to die you know they have maybe as long as they keep feeding you with feeding tubes or as long as they keep you in a breathing machine or whatever you can maybe live for many many years that way. Do you want that? Do you want that for yourself? Do you want that for your loved ones? Or would you rather not make a decision now let them other people make the decision later? It can be agonizing for surviving relatives to have to face this issue about what to do about a loved one who's in a coma and the doctor says you know this person has brain damage they're not going to die unless we you know stop feeding them and it's agonizing and families get split up sometimes about you know decisions around this. So if you can make that decision ahead of time and make it known it can be helpful. If you have severe brain damage to the point that you can't speak and also can't recognize the people around you what would you want then? You want to stay alive at all costs or would you like to quietly go out then? What is your what is your choice? Do you want to see receive life support treatment or medical treatments at whatever financial cost to your own estate or to the finances of your relatives? Is there a financial cap that after which you know you know this is not worthwhile I'm dying anyway I'm going to die within a few months or a week or some days and you know at some point if you have insurance I suppose people don't worry about this too much but there can be financial decisions that come into play. Many years ago 30 years ago I met this guy who lived in a commune a little real commune in Oregon and he was the first person who ever told me that he had a ceiling and how much money he wanted to spend for his to stay alive and he said back then that if it costs more than ten thousand dollars to keep him alive then he didn't want to be kept alive. Now ten thousand dollars doesn't go very far anymore doctors but but I was really impressed like this guy had thought about this and he felt his his his argument was that anything more than that was taxed other people taxed the environment taxed the whole world too much and it wasn't worth it that was his decision and do you have such a thing you have some thoughts around financial limit and then what instructions do you have for pain management again for buddhist this is particularly important because you want to try to stay as conscious as you can and if you're not able to make the choices because you can't speak anymore then are you leave instructions behind about how much pain medication that you want to be given sometimes people can get a sense that the person is in a coma or kind of unconscious and still distressed because they seem to be in pain and do you want to be left alone and not have any pain medication even when you show show signs of distress deal deal on your own with what's going on there or do you want pain medication to you know to settle you out so you're prepared to endure a certain degree of pain in favor of maintaining mental clarity if it seems that you're in pain while in a coma do you want pain medication and if so how much do you want other kinds of medication medication or medication for depression for nausea for shortness of breath hallucinations do you want that kind of you want that or do you want to be left alone let nature take its course and then you know the thing the other thing is what are your wishes around organ donations you know if you have any wishes along those lines so those are kind of you so you can get legal documents and at some point i'm putting i'm trying to write a little manual for a center here so people can have resources for themselves and i'll put some of these things but you know if you have kaiser kaiser just use these things and there's other places this this this has various ways of getting this document that can be filled out and and instructions of what to do and i'd encourage you to take this and and yes and so so i'd encourage people to do that the other thing is so those are kind of the more bigger practical questions and there's more specific instructions that you have that you want to give people for your dying and again this can be very helpful to have that in written form or at least certainly tell someone about it for example where do you wish to die do you have a choice in preference where you wish to die and it can be very specific you know you might say well i want to if it's possible i want to die at home but then you might say where in your home you want to die some people further bedroom perhaps or some people might want to die in their living room or they might have some you know you might have or in their garden you know i don't know i never heard that but i can imagine someone saying wheel me out to the garden and and so you have any particular wishes that you have about where you want to die and probably should specify that you don't want to you don't want to die in intensive care if at all cost intensive care tends to be a rather busy place and if you if there's a choice for moving someone who's dying away from intensive care to acquire a room please talk to the doctors or to the hospital and try to make that happen um it's really helpful to create a peaceful environment as much as you can for the person who's dying and sometimes intensive care is not the place for that so where do you want to die who if anyone do you want to be present when you die um you might have your own you might have preferences around that um i know some people prefer to die alone and um and so you know to give some instructions around that you know if it looks like a right you know coming up to the last minutes i'd like to have some time quiet time or i'd like to be alone uh some people seem to die when they're left alone and it seems kind of like a choice you know people go off to make a cup of tea and they come back and the person is dead and it seems perhaps that uh you know it was easier to let go when no one was there um who do you want to be notified if you're dying if you don't have the opportunity to notify people who should be notified and um and have a list of that you know some place so that people who are surviving don't have to be you know stretching their minds thinking about who would that person want and um there might be people they wouldn't think about for example i mean if you're the only buddhist you know in your family your extended family and you're kind of a closet buddhist at that and uh and but for you it'd be really valuable to have some of your buddhist friends there or to have a buddhist teacher present it wouldn't have occurred maybe to your family to to have to to have such a person come uh unless you specified ahead of time it's you know it's really important for me to have this person come um there's one person in our sangha who has clearly written down instructions that when she dies she's in a nursing home that and all these people know this that i'm supposed to be notified and they have my phone numbers and and when she dies i'm supposed to be called right away or just or while she's dying when they know that's going on and um because she wants me to come and whether i can be there while she's dying she would like me to be there as she dies but if i can't get there in time she would like me to be there with her body after she dies kind of attend to it for a little bit so the instructions she has about you know uh if i die and you know in hospital or somewhere um please leave my body alone until gil can get there that's what she says um what do you want done while you're dying so i mean spiritually kind of practice wise say that you can't talk anymore you can't express your wishes do you want people to be reading certain passages poems uh loving kindness discourse passages from tibetan book of the dead or some kind of passages that you that they're helpful for you something that's inspiring something that's meaningful for you um it can be very helpful to have selected uh some passages to be read or book to be read or something while you're dying not just for your own sake but uh sometimes it can be helpful for your loved ones because they so they have something to do and it makes it a lot easier if they feel like they have something to do rather than just sitting there you know wondering what they should do to sit quietly whatever giving them some sense of meaning and purpose is helpful it helps you in return because they're quieter more settled and um and um so you know selecting readings ahead of time perhaps you'd like some guided meditations and maybe there's specific ones that you like to do and there's various places you get guided meditations from some of them are specifically have to do with death and dying and so you can have those being read to your to you or told to you or a teacher or someone can come and do guided meditations do you want chanting do you want someone to come to chanting or do some buddhist rituals would you like someone to come like me to come for example and perform a refuge ceremony for you this is one of the spiritual things that people do preparing for dying is they do take refuge they do refuge ceremony and i've done that at people's death bed come to them and done the refuge ceremony done the chanting but also if people are in a coma or unconscious or semi-conscious uh to give instructions you like to do that if i'm invited in to someone's home or some situation where someone's dying and they're unconscious or um and i know them from the sangha here um i would uh chant the refuges for them with them that's what one of the things i would do um kind of pretty pretty automatically and um and hopefully that's okay with both you and mostly i'm concerned about you doesn't have to be okay for other people um do you want people in meditation around you um you know what would you like to happen do you want certain music to be played do you want silence um do you want you know a buddha image nearby do you want to have you know just your what are your wishes so to specify that think that out ahead of time and that's like very very powerful because it really makes your own death really uh much more real for you to plan out what would you want what's important for you and it helps you kind of clarify what is a great value to you what is a great existential value what's a great great value to you at this very important juncture in your life when you're dying it's a great reflection to do um so oh oh so you know the um it's often said you know that dying uh can be a form of letting go it's kind of letting go that happens the implications of the buddhist uh theory or idea of rebirth is that dying doesn't mean that you are able to let go completely it's because you don't let go completely that you get you get reborn if you're still clinging that's the it's the force of clinging that causes the next birth to happen if there's no clinging no attachment there would be no fuel there'd be no cause no condition for further birth so what this implies then is that um it means that dying itself is not doesn't like doesn't involve letting go of everything and so practicing letting go and having other people encourage you to let go as you're dying can be very helpful so you know have someone come to your bedside and even if you're you know unconscious or removed yourself your senses have drawn in and you're not really tuning into the world around you maybe you want to have someone come and and give instructions and letting go it's one of the things i would do if someone was in the last moments or minutes of their death or last period of their life and even if they say you couldn't communicate with them so much anymore i would try to intuit at best i could where the person was at what was going on with the person and whether i thought it was appropriate to actually then give instructions to the person encourage the person guide the person in letting go and in the final moment even if even if someone's in a coma i believe that the words can get through and and so that's one of the things i would do if someone was dying so what's the buddhist view on the moment of death um you know as many of you are so much familiar with in tibetan buddhism there's an intermediate period so between your final your your final moment of this life when you die and the next birth in terevad and buddhism the tendency there is much more to believe that rebirth happens instantaneously as soon as you die then you're going to get reborn somewhere else or almost instantaneously there's not like a long intermediate period however the important issue is when is the moment of death and i'm not an expert on this i don't feel like i know for sure maybe no one really knows when the exact moment of death is there's i don't know there are medical definitions of when death occurs but just because a person has stopped breathing you said oh that's the last breath the person has not breathing anymore that in terevad and buddhism is not the definition of death definition is when the final breath occurs and when there's no longer any temperature in the body when all the body temperature has got dissipated and the body is cold and that can happen slowly over different parts of your body sometimes the chest is maybe the last to release its heat and so what this implies to me is that is you know i don't really know exactly how long or when exactly death occurs there is a transition period time so i want to be very careful that i don't take the first signs oh this person has died as being this is when the person has actually died this is when the person is no longer able to listen to instructions or hear or go through their process so i would want to be very careful about that time after the last breath and keep the room very quiet and very peaceful try not to have a lot of or any talking at all if someone is grieving or wants to cry to try to do that somewhere else at that moment to try to keep that room as quiet and peaceful as possible to help that person because they still might be going through the process of letting go who knows how long it is it's often commented upon that the last moment of death i don't know if it's all universal is true but i haven't seen that many deaths but the last moment of death is peaceful it's often a kind of peacefulness sets in and even though it might be difficult up to the very last moment there's sometimes a kind of a peaceful quality that sets in into the room sense emanating from the person perhaps there's kind of a peaceful sense that happens and when that peaceful sense happens align yourself with that stay with it be in harmony with it stay in that peaceful mode maybe continue talking to the person if in a way that's helping them in that process of letting go and dying and certainly don't be in a hurry to call if a person's dying in the hospital to call in the doctors or the nurses to tell them the person is that you know is now dead there's no need to hurry and tell anyone i think if the person's that you know death is not a medical emergency and um so um you know keep keep things quiet and peaceful sometimes people have the sense that uh there's a presence still there there's a consciousness is still there that you kind of and you kind of because somebody is still there for a while and at some point it feels like it's leaving the body some people have a sense sense that it actually leaves certain part of the body it leaves a chest or their head some people get the sense that it's some kind of presence or consciousness or life force it still hovers in their room for a while so any kind of sense like that a sense of palpable peace in the realm or from the body a sense of presence that's there still you want to try to be uh one of the reasons to meditate after a person has died like that is just try to stay tuned in to the subtle uh cues subtle sensations subtle perceptions you might have but what's going on there at that time so you maybe can be supportive or be aligned or in that process um at some point uh maybe you have a more definitive sense that the person is now really dead the presence is gone the peace is quality of peace has changed perhaps um at some point you maybe you want to start attending to the body um what in this if there's this peaceful period right afterwards and you feel a sense of presence still there it's best it's said often it's best not to touch the body because if the if the dying process is slow process if it goes beyond for a few minutes or something beyond the period of the last breath then you don't want to disturb the person you want to let disturb the process that's going on so you don't want to touch the body because that said you know might disturb i don't know if that's true but that's what it said um the uh um i think i have my understanding is that in normal circumstances rega mortis takes sets in around after about two hours and so if you want to do something with the body that involves moving it it's good to do something with those first two hours like if you want to dress the body into some respectful nice clothes that seem appropriate it's usually best to put on something that's very lightweight the cool because of the decay process so that you keep things cool or just to put a light cloth over the person um a um some people prefer to have the eyes shut and i've tried sometimes closing the eyes and holding my hands there with the eyes for a while and i've never had any luck with that and no one ever told me this until recently i read about it so i don't have any experience with this um is to use tape tape the eyes down anybody done that anybody put tape over the eyes yeah you don't know the hospice and uh and uh just scotch tape there's a special tape that comes in the bag and it's just an athletic tape and take the teeth out before rigor mortis fits in take them out i thought you'd make sure they're in stay in well because once you rigor mortis and you come won't get him back in again yeah i don't know there was one i don't remember one night when we wanted to get the teeth out and they weren't going oh if it's important to you to get them out get them out and then how long do you keep the tape on um i see it just i mean i think it's strange you mean all these loved ones is around and you know they're putting flowers around the head and they're kind of sitting very tight and this tape is there and there's also this thing of you could tie i haven't done this either but i know about this technique of using a scarf and tying up their their jaws so they close their mouth so it doesn't stay open because it looks nicer with the mouth closed looks more dignified for some people sometimes and it was and there was enough oh oh you don't wait i mean uh some there's some point it's fine to touch the body the uh it just it's uh it's just this nebulous this uncertain uh period of time when you think death dying is still happening uh that is beyond maybe the last breath i mean so a lot of people people say well that last breath means the person's really dead but my sense my buddhist sense is that uh you don't really know for sure what the process is what's really going on and so you want to you know try to intuit or sense or feel um you know beyond that last breath however long it seems like respect respectful amount of time to leave the body alone to let some process go on as long as you sense some presence in the room perhaps maybe if you can don't touch the body at some point you feel like now it's time or now it's okay or you feel like enough time has gone by and my own sense is it's not not so long you know it's not like you know you know it's a matter for me you know it's a matter of i don't know what it is i mean i felt different things yeah i think this thing about the advanced draft is really really important because we didn't have that with my mother and so the institute where they live they have to start doing all these valiant means and it looked like that with four relatives she she was uh dead when i got there but it looked like a scene of mayhem in some way just you know this tube down all this straps and so on it was very it was actually very disturbing yeah it was the only death that was disturbing the other ones were just you know so i really encourage people to do that make sure they're all just preferably before you're ready to go it's easier time to really get all that square away so that then an institution in the minute or whatever doesn't do these things which they have to do really yeah so i know there's some buddhist uh that uh i have all kinds of ideas about you know don't do an organ donation until there's been a transfer of consciousness and you have a ritual for do it like in tibetan buddhism at powa in terabon buddhism they don't have these elaborate uh understandings of this process of of uh transference of consciousness and rituals and all that that you can do it's much terabon buddhism tends to be much tends to be much more simple and you know all these processes but um so in that case in terabon buddhism you know it's pretty quickly but i think the the idea is that um if a person wants to donate the buddhist view i i would argue is that if a person wants to donate an organ donate the organs it's an act of generosity it's a good deed and and so if that's what the person does it's doing this wonderful wholesome thing that do it as soon as it makes sense maybe let there be a couple of minutes of time just after the last breath let some respectful time go by don't just rush the person off not only for the person who's died sick but also for the sake of loved ones who are there they have a chance to be with that i don't know the procedures for for uh donations and how quickly it has to be and and um i'm sure the quicker the better but um my sister got a kidney last year and uh she knew she was going to get the kidney from this person before the person died because the person was in a i think a coma or and the family was deciding to you know i guess they decided to do remove life support systems from the person and so the person was really alive and my sister knew she had to you know get ready to go to the hospital and uh so in that circumstances i don't know whether you know i don't know you know you know whether they have them on the operating table when they when they remove life support and just you know it's done right away or whether the family is there quietly around the bed and and i don't know i don't know how that's done i'm sure the family's wishes count for something go that has to be very carefully orchestrated and in many cases prepared for advance so that there is something that happens through the pre-prequitment that the body creates a seemingly rapid transformation of the body. If that is the wish of the person, your wish or something, I don't see any spiritual problem myself with the process of doing that. I don't know. It's hard to know the channels and byways of karma and spiritual processing and all that, especially at that moment. But my sense is that if that's what the person's wishes are, it's a wonderful wholesome, it's helpful for the person who is dying in whatever process they are going through after their death to have done this wonderful thing, very powerful, generous thing to do to make organ donation. And so it should be done following the medical, pretty much the medical directions as much as you can. If it's possible to leave the body alone for a couple of minutes, let the family be with the body for a couple of minutes, I think that's much better for everyone concerned. But the wishes of the doctor, I think, should take precedent because the person who's donating the organs, I'm sure they want to have the best job happen as possible, right? They want it to be successful. Yes? I think there's something that they call organ harvesting. I think they take the operation before your death. Yeah, I don't know enough about this. Possibly. I want to say something about organ donation. I investigated it about two years ago and discovered that it is not very well codified. It doesn't seem to be a central place that you express those wishes that can court them appropriately. And I know that most people in this room know that you can attach something to the back of your driver's license, but you're not necessarily going to be next to that piece of paper at the moment where it matters. And so I would encourage you to tell everybody that you know exactly what you want and fill something out and give it to every doctor you see and give it to them again the next year when you see them and remind them and just make sure your relatives know about it. Because unless you tell them specifically that you want to do that, you know what it's going to ask you despite what, you know, the ER says or whatever, some TV program that occurred, is that it doesn't happen that way. And I am also spoken to Dr. Prince who told me that it's a serious, serious problem because there are waiting lists of people who desperately need this and people who don't know how important it is for them to continue the network. Yes? Regarding the durable power of attorneys for healthcare, I was advised, I think very smartly, that when you fill that out and you specify what you'd like to have done, that you choose very carefully who it is you'd like to have done. Take care of those wishes for you because oftentimes at the time of death, well if your family is anything like my family, there can be some arguments about how things are going to go down. And also I think it's hard, say for a spouse, it could be at the time of death to really follow through on turning off machines and things like that. And it's important that you find somebody who is really willing to honor that for you no matter what. And maybe has the strength also to stand up to other people. Exactly. Thank you. And yes? I'm going to say that there are some cases, no matter what someone would like to have done with their body, that there are many cases, especially with the advent of padamore cancers, that what you wish cannot be done because the disease, they do not want to transfer to someone else. Also, that reminds me that if a person dies at home, for example, that the ideal thing is to leave the body alone for a while. I was trained in the Zen tradition where there was a custom of leaving the body alone for three days after death. It was considered very important to leave it alone for just three days. And I don't know whether it's helpful for the person who has died if the body is left there for three days. I mean, part of the argument is they're still in the process, they're in the barcode kind of stage, and you should leave it alone for three days if you can. And sometimes at Zen Center we would get ice, it's dry ice I think it was, and the body stayed in dry ice if it was hot. And I remember it was quite something to see. We would go sit with the body 24 hours a day after the person died. And there were various stages of getting bloated. One woman, a member, who was quite interesting to watch the changes. So I don't have any strong feelings about how useful or not useful it is. But it might be useful for the people who survive, who, you know, family. You might want to like that. You might like to have, feel it's respectful for the person who has died to keep them there for a while. You might feel it's helpful for the process of coming to terms with it. People from out of town have a chance to come and see the body before it goes away. That's a choice that you have to make. You know, how long do you want to keep the body at home? If the person dies at home and it's not a medical emergency, then it's, you know, you're probably better off not calling anybody like a medical person. Like a coroner or 911 or even a doctor. Just let it be. That can come later. And if you end up calling 911, for example, you might find all the fire department at your door, ready to burst it in. You're all sitting there very serenely with your loved one. You have candles going and flowers. And suddenly they come in with equipment and burst in. And so you want to be careful, you know, so you know who you call and what you call before. So you can kind of keep the atmosphere, keep things intact for as long as possible. The, if it is a medical emergency, it means to say that someone has a heart attack and you call 911 and they come and the person can't be revived. Then I believe you pretty much have to let them take the body to the coroner's office and you don't have much choice at that point. I know there's a friend of mine named Daniel Barnes has been trying to train paramedics and firefighters and things like that and train counties and get counties to change their procedures so that when someone dies, definitely dies at home, that they can just really be left there when the medics come. But I don't know locally what exactly the rules are. But partly they need to, if it's not clear why a person has died, then they have to go and get an autopsy done. Once you have a death certificate, then you can do anything. Once you have a death certificate, there's a lot of freedom that you, much more than you can probably imagine, what you can do with the body. And don't let any hospital or mortuary tell you otherwise. Once you have a death certificate, you can go, in San Mateo County, you can go to the Department of Vital Statistics and get a permit to transport the body yourself if you'd like to, if you think that's something you'd like to do. And some people prefer to do that themselves. For example, if it's a child who's died, a young child, you might want to actually prefer to carry the body home, have it really close by rather than have it be more impersonally. And I've known some, I knew some, I met someone recently, that's what she did with her young daughter who died, carry her home. And you can also, in San Mateo County, you can actually bury someone on your own property. But you have to get the property owner's notarized permission. But you can get a permit to do that. You can also, you're supposed to get a permit for dispersing the ashes, if that's what you've done. And you go to, I guess you go to the Vital Statistics office and you get, yes? As far as dispersing the ashes, if the person is making arrangements ahead of time, like with the crematorium before they die, and this was my experience a couple months ago, is that they've said the final resting place, there's a spot for it on the death certificate. The final resting place will be, and in this case it was in Hawaii, so the ashes, we had no trouble at all transporting ashes, and the legality of getting permission or going through everything was dispersed by just having that on the death certificate, the final resting place will be. And then that, you know, you can travel state to state or travel the world. I'm not so familiar with this part, but yeah, so there's a lot you can do. And you don't have to, you know, you can, and so don't, you know, if you have your own wishes or if the person had his or her wishes, assume they can be done before someone, you know, and call the appropriate people, call the, in Semitel County you call the Vital Statistics person. And they'll tell you what can and can't be done. That's probably enough for today. Yes? What about in Bongi? Is there any Buddhist feeling about that? There are a lot of different customs in many different Buddhist traditions about what to do with the body. There's a kind of a general, generalized view that Buddhists do cremations. That's kind of general, but that's not necessarily always the case. And even in Thailand, certain people get cremated and some people don't, often depending on the kind of death that's been. If it's a suicide, for example, then sometimes don't get cremated or the cremation is put off for some time. But generally the kind of general sense is that the cremation is the Buddhist way. But there's a burial is fine. A lot of Buddhists use burials. A lot of Buddhists, you know, Tibet, there's, you know, sky burial with the sky burial. And that's where you leave the body out there and the cliff stops for the vultures to eat. And there's a lot of different ways of doing it. And there's nothing wrong with embalming. However, embalming has a lot of toxins in it. And I read recently, maybe you read it in the Chronicle this last few days, there was an article about this, that if the claim was that the embalming fluids are a little bit toxic to the environment. So it's not really the best thing to do. The article also claimed that cremating is toxic to the environment because our bodies have a lot of lead in them. You know, probably more than we'd like to admit. And lead and other mercury and other things like that. And so I guess there's a movement now to get the crematoriums to have scrubbers on their smokestacks so that they clean these things out. But you know, you're releasing all this stuff to the environment, to the air. And so this article in the Chronicle last week argued that, it was arguing for green burials. And they suggested that you want to be buried without being embalmed in the ground. And in their way, their way was, they were suggesting this happened in California, it hasn't happened, isn't in South Carolina. Someone bought like a thousand acres to be a nature preserve. And then they funded the nature preserve, buying this to save this land by using 200 acres as a place to bury people. And bury people green, where it means that there's no embalming. And use a simplest kind of pine or cardboard coffin to bury people. And all you do is you put a like a, you don't put a tombstone over the person, you just put a like, you know, a nice rock or something. And so it's kind of just helping preserve nature there. And I think that's very much in the spirit of Buddhism. Ajahn Buddha Dasa, who was a great Thai teacher, his instructions for when he died, which were not followed by his loyal students, was, he said, just take my body and prop it up against a tree in the woods and just let it decay. Let nature take its course. And another abbot that I know, said, who's still alive, said that I don't care what happens to my body. I just want it to be, whatever happened, just let it happen quickly. Just take it and burn it. And if they want to do rituals, whatever, it's fine. But just burn it and get it over with. I don't want to, simpler the better. There's a kind of, sometimes a little bit in Theravān Buddhism, a kind of, I don't know what the right word is, nonchalance, not bravado, but kind of a, you know, this is a completely natural process. Let's just do it in a natural way. Simply and straightforward as we can. Let's not make any big deal about it. Let's just, you know, get it over with and just put me in the woods and let me decay or whatever. And I know that Theravān teachers emphasize the great value of the whole burial and process to be as simple as possible. Funeral Memorial Service, that simplicity is a virtue in Theravān tradition. And you don't want to have a big elaborate state funeral that they did for Buddhadasa. Yes? To round up the discussion, Spence a lot of time talking about conscious dying, as soon as you know you didn't die, but speak out, especially true in the Sangha, that a number of us will just die, whether they're part-tact or die in a sleep, like a person did in the Sangha, or die in a meal accident. Do you have any words to say about preparing for that? Well, and prepare for it. Get all your everything in order, get all these documents, all your wishes, it's known ahead of time. Before you go to sleep every night, make sure that you're not holding any grudges. And if you are, you know, resolve them, deal with them. And, you know, so that there's no regrets. So, you know, I think that. Practice the best you can, develop good habits of practice. Because even though death might be relatively sudden, I kind of operate with the assumption that it's never going to be instantaneous. And so there's always going to be some moments there for some kind of process to go on. And if there's clarity, if there's mindfulness, if there's a trust in that process of letting go that's been built up over a lifetime of practice, then maybe some of these resources you've developed will be available even for those last few instances, if you know. If that's what's happening. So I'm kind of, you know, hoping for the fact that even relatively fast deaths, there's a process going on there and hopefully unprepared for that process. And I'm very generally, you know, for my own sake, my own dying. You know, if it happens, I would say this. You know, I never know how people don't know how they're going to die, but I have kind of a good feeling about dying. I don't want to die. And I feel terrible now that I have children and all that. I don't want to die anytime soon. But the idea of dying itself seems to me as without having gone through it that I can remember. It seems to me that it has to be very close, very comparable, probably almost the same process as deep meditation. I feel like it's very familiar to me. I feel like it's a familiar thing. And it's something that I welcome because it seems so familiar and something that I feel a lot of comfort in, a lot of possibilities for peace in that process of letting go that happens in deep meditation. And I'm assuming it happens also as well. And I'm assuming it happens as well as I die. And my hope is that, you know, my hope is I can stay conscious enough for that process. How conscious we are in a coma for the process is, you know, no one really knows how much mental processing is going on. You know, there might be very subtle levels of consciousness that are operating. Yeah. In terms of consciousness, I think there is a physiological process in people who die and there are endorphins being released in the body. And I have the feeling that people retreat inside themselves somehow and do not communicate anymore. And that's the best way to die. And this is certainly what happened to my mother who was just about 100 years old. It might be different depending on what age she died and which circumstances. But I think there are certainly some processes that you stop eating. Sure. And it helps with the release of endorphins which make you feel more comfortable. Yes. And you know, there's a lot of really good books on this topic of death and dying that, and, you know, written by people understand this process much better than I do. So I don't think if you're interested in this, part of the preparation would be to read some of these books with layouts, a lot of these different things. And one of the traps of people who have read Stephen Levine or read about all the wonderful Buddhist teachers who have died in meditation is to assume that the right way or their way is going to be blissful. It's going to be great. It's just wonderful letting go and white light and the angels singing and just wonderful and peaceful and all these nice people around me. And I think it's like one of these things you have to let go of is even being able to plan or even hope, you know, even the hope for a good death. You don't know. It's a process which is outside of your control. And certainly part of deep spiritual life is letting go of control. So, you know, sometimes deaths are difficult, very difficult and very painful. And I might be terrified, you know, as much as I can say with my bravado that, you know, it's a welcoming process and I feel comfortable with the idea. I could just be deluding myself and, you know, it could be very different. So certainly, you know, I certainly have some various general ideas of how I'd like to die. And maybe everybody has some ideas. Some people prefer to die in their sleep, not to know about it. And yeah. It's been a long time since I've been talking about what dying is like for the person who's dying. And I, you know, I can't, I don't know much about that. Obviously, I don't know much about that. But I do have to come to one conclusion. It came to you a long time ago, but it was really brought home by my mother's brother who died about four or five years ago. And he absolutely refused to have a funeral. It was stated that there would be no funeral. And dying is whatever it is. Funerals were for a living. We'll talk about that a little bit next week. The Funerals Memorial Service and the Buddhist versions of it and what you can do. That's part of next week. Did you follow up with us on Friday? Friday. Come and prepare to die. So this Friday from nine thirty to three thirty we have a practice day. We're going to practice retreat on the theme of death and dying. So we'll do some exercises and discussions and practice, you know, deal with it ourselves. Our attitude towards our feelings towards it. I'm not sure I haven't decided exactly what to do yet, but. Sounds better than work. What? Sounds better than work. So thank you very much. And I hope this, you know, was certainly provocative for you to think about this more deeply. Consider some of these issues. Thank you.
