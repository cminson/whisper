The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So I'm kind of happy that the topic for the last Sunday of the year is equanimity,
in particular the Brahma-Vihara of equanimity. It's the theme for the next five
weekday morning sittings from 7 a.m. and so I wanted to kind of give more of an
overview today or introduce the topic. But it seems pertinent given what this year,
2020, has been about. A year ago I think none of us could have imagined how different our
life would be this year and how disruptive, how challenged we were as a society and as
a world and as individuals and maybe as families. And to end to have gone through
this year with mindfulness would have meant that you would also have learned a bit about
yourself, learned about how you are and the challenges of the world. You would have
practiced with it and one of the things to consider in practicing and being present for
the challenges of the year is what wisdom has this year brought you. And with your
wisdom, what equanimity has been cultivated? Or what equanimity can you now call on given
what you've gone through this year? What are your more at ease about? What are you more
not activated or agitated by and have maybe more, it's easier. You're not, you're not,
you're going to keep your ease through something that a year ago would have been
challenging for you. And how could you develop more equanimity? So this depends
a little bit on what we mean by equanimity. Some people don't really like the term when
they hear about it because equanimity can feel like it's kind of an aloofness or
indifference or a coldness that was somehow cold and unresponsive to what's happening
in the world. And I think that it's the opposite, that when there's a quality of
equanimity that what has, there's actually a lighter feeling and more open feeling,
a feeling of more spontaneity and ease because the forces that get in the way of
equanimity are the very forces that get in the way of lightness, of ease, of
spontaneity, of freedom themselves. And so sometimes because of the challenge people
have around the topic of equanimity, sometimes it's useful to look at the opposite,
what is not equanimous. And very quickly I think we see that kind of the opposite
of equanimity is usually not a very desired state. At least in the, in the
Buddhist teachings, the opposite of equanimity is usually a pair of mental
actions that we can do. One is called repulsion and the other is attraction.
Sometimes the second is called greed. When the mind is activated with a sense of
revulsion or repulsion, aversion, hostility, the mind is agitated and stirred up
and hot. And when the mind is activated by strong attraction and greed and lust,
the mind is activated and not very equanimous, not very peaceful. And it's
learning not to, developing oneself, so those states don't predominate.
Those states are not here in the forefront. The absence of revulsion,
repulsion, the absence of greed or strong attraction to want is a mind that's
available and open and is able to be present without the filters, without
the bias that repulsion, revulsion of even the mildest forms or greed and
attraction, even the mildest forms sometimes predispose us to. That generally
when we're caught in the grip and the mind is activated by these two polar
forces, it puts on, we have colored glasses, we have preferential ways of
thinking and reacting and evaluating our situation. That if we have no repulsion
towards anything and have no strong attraction, attraction here means not
just simply appreciating something and liking something, but somehow caught in
the grip of pursuing something, then the mind is much more peaceful. And the
mind is equanimous, is not restless. Restless mind is not so nice. It's not
agitated. Generally, an agitated mind doesn't feel very pleasant to be in.
And it's not contracted or sunk or depressed in any way. So the absence of
all those things is what in Buddhism is called equanimity. And it's very highly
valued in Buddhism, this quality of equanimity, so much so that it's like
they say there's many different words for snow or rain or soil. I used to be a
soil scientist and there's all these different kinds of soil. When I studied
soil science, I was amazed at how many different names there are for soil,
different kinds, depending on how much sand or clay there is in it or different
things. So the Buddhists have, where equanimity is applied in many different
areas, there's all these lists that have equanimity as a last factor of the list.
So, for example, the seven factors of awakening, equanimity is the last. The
four Brahmaviharas, the four kinds of love, equanimity is the fourth love. The
Paramis, the ten kind of beautiful or healthy or pure qualities of character
that gets cultivated in Buddhism. The last one is equanimity. The four Jhanas,
the four deep states of concentration, the last one is characterized by
equanimity. So here we come to the end of the year and seems like the last talk of
the year can be equanimity, which seems very nice. In terms of the Brahmaviharas,
these four kinds of positive regards, ways of being in the world with love,
equanimity is a kind of love, is a kind of way of caring for the welfare and
happiness of the world. It's an expression of kind regard or supportive
regard for the world. And to connect equanimity with love is also something
which is not so obvious to people. The idea is that we start, then we start,
but there are the first three Brahmaviharas of goodwill, loving kindness,
compassion, and then appreciative joy. So to celebrate the joy, rejoice in the
joy and the well-being of others. And these three are said to get perfected
with equanimity. And why the first three get perfected with equanimity is
because the near and far enemy of each are no longer there, they're combined
with equanimity. So the near enemy for loving kindness is sentimental
attraction or attachment to others, kind of feeling the allure and the pull
and the sticky attachment of lust or different things. It looks like it
might be loving kindness, but there's usually a self-agenda that we want
something for ourselves in a kind of attraction to others that can sometimes
happen. Exactly how that is, what the right word is to call that, I'm not
sure, but it looks like goodwill, looks like loving kindness, but it has a
personal agenda of something we want for ourselves in it. And then on the far
enemy of loving kindness is hostility, ill-will. The near enemy of compassion
is distress. Extreme form is being horrified at the suffering of the world,
being distressed by it, being disturbed by it. And it can seem like the
disturbance is not too great, like the very nature of disturbance is the
compassion. It's confused for compassion. The far enemy of compassion, the far
enemy means that which can't coexist with compassion, is that it destroys
compassion entirely, is wanting to harm people, cruelty. The near enemy of
sympathetic joy or appreciative joy is that when the joy is self-referential
in nature, so it can be a certain kind of giddiness, a certain kind of
relief, a certain kind of taking delight, because it feels so good for
myself to do that. But rather rejoicing is really an opening and rejoicing
outwards for the goodness of other people without really being consumed
or caught up with it for oneself. And the far enemy is jealousy and envenous,
dislike about someone having a good time or having success. So both of
those kind of far and near enemy are generally when the Brahma-Viharas are
somehow entangled with self-preoccupation, self-concern, getting something
for oneself. To discover real freedom in these Brahma-Viharas is to discover
how not to be self-preoccupied with them and just really being an openness
and a big yes to the situation we're in. Sometimes the yes comes as loving kindness,
sometimes as compassion, sometimes as rejoicing, and sometimes as equanimity.
And so when equanimity is developed and combined with these others,
it purifies loving kindness, compassion, and appreciative joy. Equanimity also
stands by itself. And the reference point for this deep Brahma-Vihara equanimity,
as it is for the others, factors, is not everyday life. And so to be judging
and questioning and wondering about what are these Brahma-Viharas and how
do they work, if you're only trying to make sense of them in your daily life,
then it's not the reference point in Buddhism for how deep and full
and meaningful these can be. Because the reference point in Buddhism is
meditation. And meditation is a place to learn, a simplicity of being.
It's a place to learn how not to be self-preoccupied or in its greed for oneself
or benefiting oneself, just kind of tight and narrow and attached kind of way, selfish way.
Egotism and selfishness gets freed as we develop more freedom in Buddhism.
And so to experience that meditation is, for some people, really a wonderful time
where we put aside our concerns for the world, our relationships with other people,
all the things we have to do, and really can settle deeply into ourselves
to feel the goodness of that, the relief, the ease of that. And with that ease,
that non-agitation, non-restlessness, that openness that can come,
that can give us a whole different relationship to love, to loving kindness,
to compassion, to appreciative joy than we can in other circumstances
when life is much more complicated. And we start feeling the simplicity of these things.
Some people might even say the purity of them when they're uncomplicated
by the self-concern and preoccupation. But these three, first three,
sometimes are not really appropriate in certain circumstances.
In some situations, things are so difficult or so unusual that our care, our love,
our unpreoccupied kind of willingness of kind regard for what's going on.
It's not really a time for loving kindness where we're wishing for people's welfare.
It's not really a time for compassion. We're wishing and hoping that people suffer less,
wishing for less suffering. And it's not really a time for rejoicing
because there's nothing going on that can be rejoiced worthy.
There are times when things are really challenging in this world.
People have great difficulties and challenges that we're in.
We have big, big difficulties and challenges. And sometimes it's actually out of our control
what people do with their lives and what people do with the choices they make.
And people make unhealthy choices or there's acts of nature, they get sick,
or all kinds of things can happen. And where these other doesn't quite work
to living in the first three Brahma Viharas.
But rather, the only thing that's left to do is to be a quantumist, to not be distressed,
to not be angry, not be afraid, not be agitated, but to keep our hearts open,
but to learn how to keep an even balance, a balanced mind.
And one of the definitions of the equanimity Brahma Viharas is having a balanced mind
or a balanced heart. So we don't get imbalanced because things are so difficult.
It's also a mind that regards people with the word of Sama, S-A-M-A,
which is often translated as evenness, levelness, but also it can be translated
kind of like the word justice, to treat everyone equal.
So to be able to view people with an evenness of mind, a balance of mind,
to view people, some people translate it as impartial, with inequality.
We're able to be with a situation, but there's a kind of, you know,
treat people fairly, evenly, nicely, properly.
But we're not agitated, not caught up in things.
So sometimes the only thing left is equanimity.
And we know we have kind regard for someone, but because the things are so difficult,
finding our place of equanimity is the best thing we can do for the situation,
and how to support other people, because the alternatives available to us
might be not so desirable.
If the alternative is to be involved in strong, or mild, or very small,
revulsion, repulsion, horror, distress, pushing something away,
or attraction, and pulling to insisting things have to be some different kind of way.
I've been the recipient of people's so-called compassion for me,
and I didn't really feel it was compassion.
I felt that they were doing this for themselves.
They were trying to insist that I be different, so they could feel different.
They could feel better.
And, you know, that's not real compassion.
And I've had been the recipient of compassion, where I felt that they kind of were unconcerned with themselves.
And it wasn't about themselves.
They just had a clear, clean, care compassion for the struggles that I had.
And so equanimity is the alternative to some of the more distressing,
and even harmful ways we can be in the world.
So to develop equanimity is sometimes, because it's so much better than alternatives,
it's a really fantastic way to develop the practice and to learn how to be in the world.
It's really crucial because we can't always bring loving kindness, compassion,
sympathetic joy to every possible situation.
And then to remember that that equanimity, then, is the channel,
is the vehicle for equanimous love, equanimous goodwill,
equanimous care, kind regard for the world.
It's not cold and aloof.
It's the opposite.
There's a warmth.
There's a softness.
There's a ease.
There's a likeness.
There's a freedom in the equanimity because it's not self-cut up.
So there's two circumstances in which equanimity, Brahmavihara, is really useful to develop
when the other three are not really the right call.
So one is when things are just so difficult.
The other is in deep meditation.
In deep meditation, it's sometimes said that the first three are a little bit more complicated.
They're a little bit more conceptual, a little bit more involved,
a little bit more consideration of the mind-mental activity.
And at some point in deep meditation, we find the limitation to get to the boundaries,
the limit to how deep and still and quiet and peaceful we can become
with loving kindness, with compassion and sympathetic joy.
And at that point, we feel that just the other side of those,
to go a little bit deeper in meditation, is there's equanimity.
And it can still feel the warmth, the kindness, the kind regard, kind of.
It's not really words or thoughts, but a glow of warmth, of peacefulness, of ease.
Where clearly there's equanimity and clearly it's radiating from us in a way that is a kind of a love.
But it doesn't have any of the subtlest little agitation, maybe,
or movements of the mind that we find with the first three.
So it's one way or the other, we find the limits to the first four forms of love.
Then we have the fourth type of love, the love that's equanimous.
And the ancient texts liken it to, have a number of similes for this equanimity, Brahma, Vihara.
One of them is, I see messages here about the link.
I'll put the link at the bottom of the chat at the end of the talk as well, so you'll get it there as well.
So similes for this kind of equanimity.
One is that if a long-lost friend suddenly appears,
you might jump up in joy and be all excited to see your friend.
After a friend's been around for a few days, weeks, months, there's a calmness that sets in.
And you're more equanimous about the friend being there.
And it's actually nice not to be always excited.
And the calm, more equanimous way of being with a friend allows for maybe now for the friendship to develop further.
They can't really develop if it's just all excitement about not having seen them for a while.
So that's an ancient kind of simile.
Another simile which works in some families is the idea that if parents have many children,
that their relationship to all the children is even or balanced, this kind of equanimous kind of relationship to each of them.
And now there's one more simile is that of parents whose child has grown up into adulthood
and is well-established and adult, has left home, established in career, family, whatever kind of, they're established.
And then the parents don't have to think about, they still love the child,
but they're no longer an active concern for their well-being.
And so the love is now is more equanimous because compassion is not needed.
There's not rejoicing because maybe because there's living their lives in a good way.
So equanimity brahma vihara, to cultivate a mind and a heart that's free of repulsion,
revulsion, attraction, greed, and to experience how wonderful it is to have a mind that's not caught in those things.
And one of the most sublime and exquisite and wonderful qualities of heart and mind is this mind that's free of attachment,
free of agitation, a mind that can be in the world without being reactive to the world,
but can be equanimous to the world and therefore respond in the way that the world needs us.
And I hope that this practice of Buddhism that we're doing is really a practice to benefit the world that we live in,
that we don't just do it for ourselves.
In fact, if you only did it for yourself, this practice,
as sooner or later, you'll come to the limit of how far you can practice,
how far it makes sense to keep practicing.
At some point, it only makes sense to practice if you're doing it also for the welfare of others in addition to yourself.
And to benefit the world around us to really be able to see the situation non-reactively with equanimity and freedom.
Then your care, your love, your kind regard, your generosity has a clean channel to respond in the way the world needs us to respond.
May each of us find the appropriate responses,
appropriate for the world and appropriate for us as the responder,
so we can respond and support creating a better world for all beings.
Thank you.
