 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Here we go. Okay. So, hello and welcome everyone to this edition of Happy Hour. So, last time, Monday, we started with the meditation. I didn't say too many words to frame it. And it was a relatively quiet one, inviting the nourishment of settling in, of peace, of quiet as an expression of metta. And many of you expressed enthusiasm for having another similar happy hour. So, let's see. Let's see how it goes tonight. I'm not going to say much. It's similar to Monday. Let's explore together. Let's see what arises, exploring silence as nourishment of metta and metta. Okay. So, let's begin. Let's begin our practice, our formal practice of meditation together. Ah. You're sitting in a chair, letting your body be upright, not uptight, but upright. No tightness needed in the muscles, but a sense of integrity in your posture. And if you need to lie down, that's okay, or stand up, do standing meditation, that's perfectly fine as well. I'm going to give the instructions assuming you're sitting now. So, assuming you're sitting, feeling your sit bones on the chair and the cushion. Paying attention. Paying attention to the body. How are you, body? How are you in this moment in time? Greeting, greeting your body with kindness. It's worked so hard all day. How are you, body? Pay attention. Now, there are places in the body that are really tired, heavy, maybe tight, maybe achy. Can you greet them, welcome them to be just as they are? Maybe there are parts of the body that are feeling good, comfortable, warm, light. Invite them too, to be as they are. And also inviting the body. I said, want to relax a little bit, let go of tightness and tension. Listen, listen carefully. Listen spaciously. Listen spaciously with your heart to the body. Listen with your heart to the body. Listen to the body. Listen to the sensations of the breath in the body, in the abdomen. Listen to the sensations of the body. Listen lovingly with the body, with the breath. Nothing needs to happen. Be just to listen. Listen to the sensations of the breath in the body. Listen to the sensations of the breath in the body. Listen to the emotions of the breath in the body. Listen to the emotions of the breath in the body. Listen to the emotions of the breath in the body. Listen to the sensations of the breath in the body. Listen to the sensations. They are loud and clear. Can you hear them? Can you sense them? Can you hear them? Can you hear them? Can you hear them? by listening to the body, relax, rest back, rest and listen to the expression of metta, to care, to be present for, to listen to our body just as it is you you you you you you you you you you you if thoughts arise take you away from the body, not a problem release them smiling with listening to their arc of coming and going and not entangled listening to the body, giving your heart the body can teach you stillness the body can teach you patience kindness, pay attention all you need to know is already here already here you you you you you you you you you you it is an expression of care, of metta be present for, be present for, to pay attention to Charter. teacher cy Consciousness your you you you you you you you you you Metta can show up in so many ways and flavors Spacious deep listening, kind presence is one way it shows up. Can we express that for our bodies, for this being who is me in this moment? Listening, listening to the sensations, the lullaby of the breath. Can we express that for our bodies, for this being who is me in this moment? Can we express that for our bodies, for this being who is me in this moment? Can we express that for our bodies, for this being who is me in this moment? Can we express that for our bodies, for this being who is me in this moment? The body is a great teacher. Pay attention, relax attention. Pay attention to the stillness. Silence between the notes. Silence between the notes in this body. Silence between the notes in this body. Silence between the notes in this body. Silence between the notes in this body. Silence between the notes in this body. Silence between the notes in this body. Silence between the notes in this body. Silence between the notes in this body. Silence between the notes in this body. And as we begin to bring this practice session to a close, opening up your sphere of awareness a little wider, not just where your body seemingly ends, the border of your skin, but as if your body was more extensive, more expensive, part of the air, the space around it and beyond, listening spaciously, internally, externally. This being who is me in this moment in time, inter-connected in vast unfathomable ways, internally, externally. So much more. This being who is me is so much more than would I take it to be. Connected, supporting others, being supported by others, appreciating perhaps with all this vast universe inside and outside, and offering our goodness, our care, our deep listening to the world as a gift. As we listen to ourselves, as we can be more present to ourselves with Metta, we can be more present to our others with Metta. May all beings everywhere, including myself, be safe, happy, healthy, and at ease. May all beings be free. Thanks everyone. Thanks for your practice. So, so what we did tonight was a practice of Metta as deep listening, as presence, deep listening internally to this body, listening to the sensations, the sensations of the breath, and really being a good student, being a good student of the body. The body is a tuning fork, as I mentioned in the meditation when there are states of mind, states of heart, emotions, etc. The body like a tuning fork resonates, so the more we get to pay attention and be present for with Metta, without pushing things aside in a way like, I don't want to listen to that. No, let me listen to that. Let me listen to it all. Even if it's quote unquote bad news, I want to know. I want to be present for it all. So tonight our expression of Metta, our practice of Metta was deep listening, deep listening to this body, sensations, and one, and the mind can get quite calm, settled. With this deep, spacious listening to the sensations, there's a lot of stillness in the body, in between the vibrations and all that, as I was describing it, like the silence between the notes as if it were music. So paying attention. So I'd like to open up the space for any reflections, questions, comments, anything you might have discovered or noticed. Denied with this practice, offered for both your own benefit and the benefit of others. Bill says, when you spoke of seeing thoughts come and go without becoming entangled in the thoughts themselves, I had a real problem with doubt. Not sure how I can do that. Ah, okay. I appreciate the question, Bill. So it takes some practice, but consider a stance, a stance of not entanglement into the thought, but knowing. Thoughts can come and go. And at first, maybe you realize it later, after you've been entangled in the thought, it's okay, then, oh yeah, I was going to be unentangled. Oh, it's okay. But in that last moment, become aware of the thought dissipating, going away. So start there. It starts there. And then, little by little, while you're in the middle of the thought, when you're still entangled, then this awareness comes. Like, oh, I'm entangled. Can I just see? Can I just step back and see? Thinking is happening. La, la, la, la, la, la, la. It can be a little bit of space. And then through this practice, then you can see thoughts are coming and going when the mind gets a little more settled without getting entangled from the beginning. But it happens step by step by step. You can't just do the whole thing at once. Start when you just wake up having been entangled and thinking for a while. Start noticing the thought going away. So that's the place to start, Bill. And that way, your confidence will be built in this practice, little by little. You are welcome. Richard, I see your hand. Am I unmuted? Yes. You know, there's always different sensations in the body, but there's also different sort of ways of being in the body, or being the body, like a yin-yang thing, a very passive thing, a very active thing. It's like every state of emotion and thought, you know, just sort of shows up differently. Yes. Yeah, there are lots of different ways about being in the body. And tonight I was specifically inviting you, guiding you to relax and to listen spaciously. That was the key word, to listen to the body spaciously. That spacious way of listening, that was an unentangled way of listening. It's a particular way of paying attention. And also it was bringing the sense of metta, care with this presence, with this spacious presence. I'll try. I'll try. Yeah, great. Thanks, Richard. Yeah, there are so many ways. Any other reflections or questions before we transition? Any aha moments perhaps you had, being present for this body, this deep listening, spacious listening? Jesse, please. Yeah, thanks, Nikki, for this practice. Yeah, this was great, you know, this deep listening practice. I've done some day-long retreats with you before on concentration practice. We should usually use the breath as a meditation object, but this felt really different. And I'm just wondering if you could maybe compare and contrast samatha or shamatha practice with this mindful deep listening that you presented tonight. Yeah, yeah. Thank you so much, Jesse. Yeah. So shamatha, samatha practice often translates as concentration, where the mind gets still when we keep coming back to an object. And usually in the West, we use the breath for this practice, though there are many different objects. And by the way, on February 4th and 5th, I'm teaching a white casino, which is a different way of developing concentrations on my schedule. If you go to my website, nikki-mergafure.com. But the body is also another way to cultivate concentration, settling the mind. The sensations of the body are definitely a concentration object. And tonight, with this invitation for deep listening, and I was talking about listening to the stillness, the silence between the notes, that was an invitation for the mind to settle into samadhi, actually. The stillness, yeah, exactly. Right on, Jesse. Great. Thank you. Thank you. Elaine says, I really enjoy turning, tuning into my body and getting a break from my thinking mind. Lovely. Another practitioner says, Thank you. This was much needed. I felt a sense of ease amidst the physical pain I've been feeling lately. Thank you for sharing that. Sandra says it was nice to quiet my mind and turn into the body at the end of the busy day. EJ asks, How can one stay with the practice in a rowdy environment? For example, kids are rowdy and shouting, caregivers are screaming, etc. Do we just try to extend the meta to all of them as well? Yes. Yes, exactly. So this practice of deep listening, when we practice when it's not so rowdy, perhaps around and we get to listen, then we can take us to where it is rowdy and we can still listen to our own heart, our own mind when there's a lot happening externally, as well as extend our full presence to others and listen to them without toppling over. It all starts internally and then of course it extends to all beings, everyone, whether they're rowdy or shouting, etc. Thank you for the reflections, everyone. So now I'd like to invite us to engage in small groups in the Sangha breakout groups and then the question for tonight's reflection. And you can choose to reflect, you can choose to just be silent, offer your silent presence is this tuning, this tuning into the body. Listening deeply into the body, this act of listening. Is there, what supports your deep listening to the body and what challenges it? What supports it and what challenges it? What is supportive? What's challenging? So what's supportive might be an environment that's not so loud. Maybe a guided meditation is supportive. And what's not supportive is when I, maybe when I try to push and I'm really, really tensing up to listen to my body, I realize actually it's counterproductive. Anyway, so your reflections, your mileage might vary, but what's supportive may be one thing, and one thing that's not supportive that you discover. And maybe you have one and not the other, like the other one, I don't know what's not supportive or what's supportive. I'm still exploring this. You can just hold space for others. So, so with that, I'd like to invite us to, to, here we go, the breakout rooms. I'm going to create them now. So as always, please just offer and reflection from yourself and make space for others. Not asking questions, not directing and let's go alphabetical order. Just offer something. Maybe you say pass. The next person, next person will come back to you. Go around and around. So take care of yourselves. Take care of each other. Here we go. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Everybody is back. And it's seven o'clock so I wonder if there's any very quick reflections from what you learned, maybe something surprising or discover. Surprising, like a 30 second reflection someone who hasn't spoken. Please. Hello. Thank you for all your teachings and sharing with us. What came up with me is just like I mostly in the mind, but this thing is more I mean with the body it's more solid and I can just feel the sensations rather than the, you know, stuff in the mind is like more ephemeral harder to catch. So thank you for that reflection. I just going to practice more staying with the body. Beautiful. Thank you so much. Ellie. Thank you for your practice and sharing that reflection. It's so fresh and the way you shared it for the benefit of everyone. Beautiful. So thank you and thank you all for your practice. May all beings everywhere be free, including ourselves. Thank you, Nikki. Thank you. Thanks everyone. So I'm going to stop.
