The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.
Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
Okay.
Okay, Brahma Viharas.
I was supposed to give this talk last April, then I got sick.
And as always, with age, things get better.
I rethought the talk I was going to give, and I was rethinking it until last night.
So if you see me shuffling around among my papers, it's a sign that I've reorganized the material.
Brahma Viharas.
The word Vihara in Pali means dwelling, and it can also mean an attitude,
like the kind of attitude you just stay in the mind, or in which you stay in your mind.
It's often used also in terms of your concentration topic.
Where is your mind dwelling right now in concentration?
So you're trying to develop, not so much thinking about the Brahmas,
but you're trying to develop the same states of mind that would make a person a Brahma.
Now Brahma is a very high level of Deva.
They get up there because they've been developing unlimited thoughts of goodwill, compassion,
empathetic joy, and equanimity.
In the Pali terms of Mehta, Garuna, Mudita, Unubeika,
Mehta, or goodwill, is a wish for happiness.
We'll get into a lot more detail on this later during the day.
It's related to the other two, Garuna and Mudita.
Garuna is basically what Mehta feels when you see someone who's suffering,
or who's acting in ways that are going to cause suffering.
You feel compassion for them, and if possible you want to help alleviate the suffering
or put an end to it.
As far as empathetic joy is, when you see somebody who's happy, you're happy for them.
You're not resentful of their happiness.
You don't feel threatened by their happiness.
However, you begin to realize there are some cases where not everybody is going to be happy,
no matter how much you wish for it.
That's where you have to develop equanimity,
realizing that there are some things that are beyond your control.
Some of the situations that people are in are the result of their past karma,
and you can't wish their past bad karma away.
This is something I can't touch.
However, you can work on the element of what you can do in the present moment.
Equanimity is not there as the final brahma vahara to which all the others go.
It's the one that keeps the others in balance.
It's what enables you to focus your attention on areas where you can be of help,
where you're made to really make a difference in terms of somebody's happiness,
your own happiness, or that of others.
What makes these brahma vaharas is that they are limitless,
both in the sense that you are able to wish them for all beings
and you're able to draw on any of them at any time,
any situation when it's appropriate.
Some people say that these are natural innate qualities of the mind.
We'll get that into a minute, into that in a minute.
But the idea of having these attitudes for everyone whenever appropriate,
that needs training.
We've got to work on that.
Because how many little kids do you know start out with goodwill for all beings?
They have goodwill for one being in particular.
And some people don't outgrow that.
So the training here is learning how to understand these qualities
and be able to draw on them at all times whenever you need them.
With metta in particular, there's a lot of misunderstandings.
I thought at the beginning of the day I'd go out and list seven misunderstandings about metta
because one of the Buddhist techniques of teaching was that
you want to present something he first would tell you what he was not talking about or what he was not saying.
So it would be very clear that you don't take what you've learned,
him say, and just try to mix it with somebody else,
what someone else is saying.
There are distinct differences here.
Years back when I was teaching down in Southern California,
this one group, I'd been teaching them for several years,
and one woman came up to me at the end of one retreat and said,
I think I understand what you're saying.
And she sort of repeated the message I've been giving that day.
And I said, yeah, I've been hearing this for years and I haven't heard it
because she'd come from another tradition,
and she was just trying to mix my teachings in with this other tradition.
And thinking basically, well, Tantyapta's not all that articulate,
so he doesn't know what he's saying, but he really means this over here.
And finally, it was getting through to it.
Yes, I meant something different.
So let's start out with some differences.
We do have a sense of, especially with metta,
we have this innate understanding because it's part of our culture.
And this is very typical in all kind of cross-cultural contexts.
Every now and then you come across something you see in another culture
and say, okay, a lot of other things in this culture are foreign,
but this I understand.
I'll give you an example.
A friend of mine went to Korea on the same program that took me to Thailand
to teach English.
And before she went, she went around and just took lots of pictures
of common American scenes, going into a supermarket,
going into a dry cleaner, all these other places that give people an idea
of what life in America is like when you're learning English.
And one of the places she went to take pictures was a Howard Johnson's restaurant.
And there was a couple of hippies sitting at the counter
and other things that you see in a Howard Johnson's restaurant.
And she was pointing out the different things that she'd taken pictures of.
And she finally got to a straw dispenser.
And she said, okay, what do you think this dispenses?
And the poor kids who had been seeing all this very foreign stuff
in the restaurant suddenly get their eyes lit up and they said, chopsticks.
And she had to stifle a laugh.
She said, no, straws.
And so we have this same problem when we come to Mehta.
We think we understand it and we fit it into our cultural background,
which is largely shaped by Christianity and its teachings on love.
And that's the first misunderstanding that Mehta is love or loving kindness.
Pali actually has another word for love, which is beima, as in beima children.
That's what her name means, is love.
And beima is equality.
The Buddha has strong reservations about it because it tends to be partial.
There are certain people you love.
And based on the people you love, you are either going to love other people
or hate other people.
There are certain people you hate.
And based on that, there are certain people you're going to love around that hatred.
He talks about how if there's someone you love, other people are kind to that person,
you're going to love those people.
Other people are cruel to that person, you're going to hate them.
Somebody you hate.
People who are kind to that person, you're going to hate.
People who are nasty to that person, you're going to love.
We see this all around us.
So the Buddha is not recommending love.
And you look at the Mehta phrases that he has.
One particular is that may all beings be happy.
And this is a phrase that monks are supposed to chant when they go into the forest
and they're going to be surrounded by all kinds of unfriendly beings.
He says, may they all be happy, may they all go away.
You find happiness your way, I'll find happiness.
My way will keep each other apart.
My teacher told a story one time when a snake moved into his room one time in Thailand.
And he decided to take this as a test for his goodwill for snakes
and his ability and his patience and his endurance.
And so for three days the snake was there in the room.
Every time he opened the door the snake would go behind a cabinet.
And the third night he finally sat and meditated and said,
look it's not that I have any ill will for you.
It's just that you're a snake, I'm a human being.
We don't understand each other's language.
It's very easy for there to be a misunderstanding.
There are lots of places out there.
Lots of places out there in the woods where you could be happy.
And the snake laughed, you know.
So metta is goodwill, i.e. a wish for happiness.
It's not love.
We're not expected to love or even like the people for whom we feel metta.
Second misunderstanding is that it's expressed by being kind and uncritical.
Now it is expressed in kindness many times,
but there are ways you can be critical
as a way of expressing your goodwill for other beings.
The Buddha gives an example.
Suppose a child has gotten a piece of sharp object in his mouth.
What are you going to do?
He asks this one prince who has his baby child sitting on his lap.
He said, well, I'll take his head and run hand.
I'll take with my finger and go into the mouth, get the sharp object out.
Even though it means drawing blood.
Because if I don't get it out it's going to be worse.
And the Buddha said in the same way,
there are times when he would have to say unpleasant things out of goodwill for people.
So it's not necessary that when you have metta for others
that you are always uncritical of what they're doing.
And sometimes you have to speak harshly with people.
This is what raising children is all about.
Another misunderstanding is that it's a quality of the heart and not of the head.
In other words, it's an expression of an emotion
and doesn't require too much thought.
We'll be going over today, though, that the fact that the Buddha said there's a lot you have to think about.
One, in the Buddhist traditions they don't make a clear distinction between your head and your heart to begin with.
Your emotions have their reasons and your reasons have their emotions.
And even though we sometimes think that we have feelings first and then we articulate them,
sometimes we have particular ideas or particular ways of verbalizing things to ourselves
that will immediately trigger a certain kind of feeling.
So the head and the heart have to go together.
They work together.
When we talk about the Buddha's analysis of what it means to fabricate your experience,
you'll see it's both emotional and mental.
So there's no clear distinction between the two.
And it means that you do have to think very carefully about what does it mean to be happy?
What does it mean to wish for someone else's happiness?
This requires a certain understanding of causality.
A fourth misunderstanding is that this quality of the heart is innate.
We all have goodwill innately within us.
The Buddha doesn't present them as innate.
There are things that you have to determine and this has to do with his view of the mind,
which we'll be getting into more detail in a little bit,
but basically your mind is capable of anything.
We've seen this again all around us.
We're not innately good. We're not innately bad.
We don't innately love other beings. We don't innately hate them.
These are choices that we make.
And if you're working with metta, it's something you have to make a determination.
You're really going to stick with this and develop this as a consciously developed quality of the mind.
He calls it determination. Determination is something that requires your discernment.
It requires an attitude of truthfulness, i.e. sticking truly to the determination.
There are things you're going to have to give up if you're going to stick with this determination.
And you have to maintain a sense of calm as you see yourself giving things up.
It's realizing that there's a greater good that's being served.
A fifth misunderstanding is that when we're expressing thoughts of good will,
may all beings be happy that it's a kind of prayer in hopes that all beings will be happy.
And that somehow...
The Buddha has some pretty choice words to say about prayer.
He was talking to Brahmin one time about the good that your descendants can do for you
after you passed away.
And he says, you know, you really can't depend on their prayers to sort of move you up in the cosmos
after you passed away.
He says it's like a group of people standing around a pool and there's a rock in the pool.
And they pray, as they circumambulate around the pool,
say, may this rock rise up out of the water.
May this rock rise up out of the water.
Is it going to rise up out of the water?
No, it's not.
Or if there's oil floating on the top of the water and they hate it and they say,
can this oil sink? The oil's not going to sink.
What we are expressing here is not so much a prayer,
and we don't even expect that the entire world will be happy.
What we're doing is establishing motivation as a basis for our actions.
Do we want our actions to cause happiness or to be conducive to happiness,
or do we want our actions to cause pain?
We're looking primarily at developing our motivation as a basis for our actions,
both as we deal with things coming in and as we go outward and express our actions
and relationship to other people.
A sixth misunderstanding is that we developed the Brahma Vihara as a whole, including Mehta,
for other people because they deserve it.
Now, coming from the Christian context, they deserve it because they are grounds of creatures.
Sometimes in the Buddhist context, you hear it said that either because other beings have Buddha nature,
you shouldn't have good will for them, or because we're all one, we should have good will for one another.
In the actual teachings that the Buddha gives, there's no question of anybody deserving good will.
Again, you need to develop this quality, this attitude towards others
because you want to learn how to trust yourself in your dealings with other people.
So it's not a question of whether you deserve it or they deserve it.
It's a question of you need this quality in order to be able to be more secure
in developing your intentions and interactions with other people.
And finally, the seventh misunderstanding is that the practice of Mehta is a complete path.
All you have to do is develop Mehta and it will take you all the way to awakening.
Like the Beatles said, all you need is love.
And the Buddha said, no, the Brahma Viharas are topics for concentration.
They are also attitudes you develop to nourish your precepts, to nourish your virtue.
But that concentration does have to have other qualities added to it or other meditation topics added to it
if it's going to be effective.
And the practice of Mehta itself has to be based on other qualities that you've developed,
being easy to instruct, having virtue.
That Mehta suit that everybody likes.
That's a pretty high bar.
If you're going to practice Mehta, this is how you have to lead your life.
You don't just sit down, it's like a goodwill for everybody in the midst of whatever else you're doing.
The Buddha also said, these qualities, if they are developed and you don't fall for them,
they can take you to the Brahma world.
But the Brahma world is not nirvana.
A lot of the scholarly confusion around this is right at that point.
As he said, the Brahma still have a very strong sense of identity,
and some of them have very wrong views.
A couple of cases where the Buddha had to go to a Brahma world and straighten out a couple of Brahmas.
So even though these Brahma vaharas can take you to that level,
you're not going to stay there permanently and there's a lot more work that needs to be done.
So those are seven of the misunderstandings you ordinarily hear about Mehta.
One is that it's love. Secondly, it's expressed by being gentle and uncritical.
Third is the quality of the heart, not of the head.
Fourth, that it's an innate quality of the heart.
Fifth, it's a type of prayer.
Six is that you spread these Brahma vaharas, including Mehta to others, because they deserve it.
There's no question of deserving at all, or not deserving.
And finally, that Mehta is a complete path.
None of these are the way the Buddha uses the teaching.
Today we're going to be focusing more on seeing the Brahma vaharas within the Buddha's context as tools for awakening.
But first, I'd like to stop and ask if there are any questions about any of those seven points.
Yes.
So on the seventh point, we've had John Peacock here, and I'm also thinking about what the Buddha thought by Richard Gombridge.
And they both make strong arguments that the Mehta can be a complete path.
Now, it sounded like you were qualifying that a little bit, that it could be a complete path if you incorporate these other factors of mind.
That's the difference between a complete path and an incomplete path.
Yeah, but for example, you don't have to cultivate Satipatana, maybe not Jhana.
I don't know if they go into that level of detail, but they do make this distinction that controversial,
and it sounds like you have an opinion that they aren't completely...
It's not just an opinion.
No, they base their arguments on two passages in the canon.
One is the Mehta Sutta, and at the end, there are certain practices that are talked about at the end of the Sutta,
which are actually in addition to the development of Mehta.
Now, the way they present it, they say, if you develop Mehta, these things will just automatically happen.
But there's nothing anywhere in the Sutta that says that that's the case,
and there's nothing anywhere outside that particular Sutta that would indicate that.
You can get into strong states of concentration, which would be Jhana, based on Mehta.
But you can't stop there.
There's no case where the Buddha is not just getting Jhana, and that's it, that's all you have to do.
That's one of the bases for their argument.
The other basis for the argument is a passage where a group of Brahmins come to see the Buddha,
actually two Brahmins come to see the Buddha, and they start talking about the way to Brahma.
How do you become one with Brahma?
And they tell the Buddha what their teacher said, and the Buddha says,
have their teachers ever met Brahma? Have they been there? No.
And he said, this is like someone who's building a staircase, and he said,
where is the staircase going? It's going to this palace over here.
Well, where is the palace? All I see is the staircase.
And then he goes on and says, do you want to know the way to Brahma?
And he said yes, and he teaches them the Brahma vaharas.
Now, Richard Gombrich at that point says, the way to Brahma, or Brahma world here,
is a synonym for nirvana.
And then he bases the whole rest of his argument just on that equation.
Now, there are many other passages in the canon where the Buddha says,
the Brahma world is an inferior attainment.
The most dramatic one is where Tananjani is dying.
Sorry, Buddha goes to see him.
And they start talking, and Tananjani is a Brahman.
And so, sorry, Buddha says, would you like to become a Brahman?
And he says, yes, I very much like to become a Brahman.
And so he teaches them the way there.
And then Tananjani dies.
And sorry, Buddha goes back to see the Buddha.
And the Buddha says, why did you leave him in an inferior attainment?
There was more that could have been done.
And there's another passage, and we'll be seeing this later in the readings,
where Mahādhānaama comes to see the Buddha and says,
when you're away at the end of the rain retreat,
we may have somebody dying here.
What kind of advice do I give to the person who's dying?
First piece of advice the Buddha says,
tell me if you're worried about your family,
or if you're worried about your family.
First it's worried about yourself.
And he says, you're worried about yourself.
And the central pleasures you're going to leave,
you have to put those aside.
Worried about your family, you have to put that aside,
because your worries are not helping anybody right now.
If you're concerned about leaving behind human sensuality,
remember there's better sensuality up there in the Davis house.
Set your mind on that.
If he sets his mind on that, you say,
okay, there's actually better than that.
It kind of takes him up the levels of the Davis
and finally gets him to a Brahma world.
He says, okay, that's even better than the central Davis,
but Brahma still have a strong sense of self-identity.
And by the self-identity there's going to be suffering.
If you can abandon that, then you go beyond the Brahma's.
And just as an aside,
Trisco was doing an interview with Richard Gombrich a while back.
And they asked me what kind of questions to ask him.
And I said, ask him about this.
The story where the, sorry, Buddha gets criticized
for taking someone just to a Brahma world.
And so they put the question in the, you know,
it was one of those email interviews.
He never answered the question.
So, question.
Let's, please.
Mic around.
So can you explain a little bit the difference
between head and heart, mental and emotional,
and how that plays into, you know, the path and the noble truths?
Okay. As I said earlier, in the Buddhist tradition,
they don't draw a clear line between your head and your heart.
In Buddhist languages, in Buddhist languages, it's the same word.
You know, your heart and your mind are the same word,
like in Thai, it's jit jai.
And I don't understand in Tibetan, it's the same as well.
And in Pali, jit dak can either be translated as heart or mind,
depending on the context.
And particularly, when they talk about fabrication,
how you shape your experience.
There's an element of will in there,
but there's also the way you think about things.
That's one of the types of fabrication
that will determine how you shape things
and why you would want to shape them in a particular way.
And so your will about things
and your sort of emotional reaction toward things
is going to be very much determined by your thinking.
How you see a situation, how you understand a situation.
So it's not we come into the world with raw emotions.
And this is an old issue they used to have in classical philosophy.
Plato was saying, you have your reason here
and you have your passions over here.
And they're two separate things entirely.
And the Stoics said, no, your passions have their reasons.
Otherwise, reason wouldn't be able to have any influence on your passions at all,
if they didn't have any reasons.
And this is one case where I think the Stoics were right.
So then the emotional does have a karmic connection with the mental.
It's kind of together.
And you might say basically,
the intellectual side is basically your sense of cause and effect
and how reason works.
And then your heart is more about what you want out of life
and where your desires go.
And in Buddhism, they're not radically separate.
Can you clarify among Anata, Sakaya Diddy and Manas?
Okay, Anata, not self.
It's an adjective.
Which means you see something and you tell yourself,
this is not me, this is not mine, this is not what I am.
Sakaya Diddy is this view that you create a sense of your self-identity,
who you are, which you create around the five aggregates.
Anata is meant to be the cure for that.
You see that I've identified with this and it's causing me suffering.
Why am I holding on?
It's basically a tool to let go.
As far as Manas is the mind or the heart or the intellect, depending on the context.
Again, that's to be viewed as not self.
In other words, you don't create a sense of identity around that.
But you use it and you've got to use your mind.
And so in certain parts of the path, and we'll be seeing this
as we go through the material today,
you have to develop a healthy sense of self.
And the Buddha encourages that up to a point.
And that's when you start letting go of some of these things.
But you basically, the original application, early application of Anata,
you've got, and I like to think, use the image of a committee in your mind.
There are certain committees and members in your mind
that you don't want to identify with.
You know they're unskillful.
And so who are you going to use to gang up on those?
If not your skillful committee members that you identify with, right?
Right?
And then when you've got everything cleared up,
okay, then you don't need anybody.
What does it feel like to have metta?
What does it feel like?
I mean the emotional side or the sort of experiential side
as opposed to just the thoughts?
So I think what I heard was a little bit of what it is not
in terms of a traditional logical definition.
I'm trying to understand what does it feel like?
It feels like you see people and you don't want to harm them.
There's a sense, okay, here's somebody I don't want to harm.
And so there's a sense of, I guess you might say,
tenderness and care around your dealings with other people.
Now you can have some people you really despise,
but you've got to have this, okay, I'm not going to do anything evil for this person.
It doesn't mean you like these people.
There's a lot of people out there who have done much to make them likeable.
But you can't have ill will for them.
Now the distinction between ill will is wanting to see them suffer.
But you can dislike what they're doing and say,
okay, I want to see if we can stop what they're doing.
But you don't want to have ill will for them.
It's sort of a non-violence, but not conceptually, but feeling non-violence.
It feels that you don't want to do violence to them,
although there are times when you have to shoot out their tires or something to stop them.
Yes, move them.
The vial?
Okay, you're in the dead spot of the sun.
A question about number four, innate,
and what I'm about to say may actually be a more lexical difference,
and not so much a semantic difference.
So recently in psychology there's been a wave of arguing that kindness and compassion are evolutionary based.
In some experiments with very young children,
babies showing that there is a tendency to be kind and compassionate.
So the way innate is used in that realm is a way to suggest that we're not inherently bad,
that there is some compassionate instinct.
But you use it, I think, is still commensurate with that, because it's a choice that we make.
So I'm just trying to make the discussion.
There's a very strong tradition in the West that comes through the Romantics and through Methodism and Piatism.
Most Americans don't realize that American Buddhist scholars say that the religion of America is Methodism,
regardless of what your denomination is.
In other words, there's a certain innate goodness to people and a certain innate quality that they want to love other beings.
But you have to recognize that is no more innate than your desire to harm other beings.
There are these potentials that are there, but we have potentials of both kinds.
It's not the case that the good will is more innate than the ill will.
They both are equally innate, if you want to talk about that, as a potential.
And in different circumstances, they're going to get developed in different ways.
But there's this feeling that somehow deep down inside, the real you is the one who feels compassion,
or the real you is the one who feels good will.
And the Buddha doesn't have that way of analyzing things.
We have potentials in both ways.
He's got a passage where he talks about how you see how variegated the animal world is.
In terms of all the many, many species in the air, on land, and in the water,
he says the human mind is more variegated than that,
that it can create more variety than even all the species of the animals.
So if you want to see innate as a potential out of many, one out of potential out of many, yes, I would agree with you there.
But it's not your true nature.
Yeah.
Thank you. Is this on?
Call it very close.
Okay. I have no volume, anyhow.
I'm very glad the person behind me who I couldn't see asked that question.
I want to push you a little farther.
So you said that metta is not an innate quality of mind.
And my question to you would be in the Pali Sutta tradition,
are there any innate qualities of mind that are not produced by karma?
No.
It's all karma.
Which gets to the next step in the talk.
We're talking about it.
One need to look at the Brahma Maharas within the Buddhist context.
And the Buddhist context is formed by the teaching on karma, what you do, and the results of what you do.
Now the reason why it focuses on karma is because, as I was saying earlier,
your mind has lots of potentials and your mind is basically active.
If we're going to talk about it in an innate quality of the mind, it's that the mind is active.
It's not a passive recipient of things.
You look at the Buddha's analysis for why there is suffering.
It starts with ignorance, and from ignorance it goes to the process of what's called fabrication.
Now fabrication is an active way of shaping your experience.
Essentially what we're doing is we're hungry and we're looking for food.
And the activities of the mind tend to go in that direction.
Physical or emotional food, are you going to be getting out of a particular experience?
And if we don't like the experience that we're presented with, we're going to try to fix it.
In the same way you've got a raw piece of meat, you don't just eat the raw piece of meat.
You cook it, you age it.
You do all kinds of fancy things to it.
Then it's edible, okay?
And we approach experience in the same way.
Experience comes to us, and the Buddha has an analysis where he talks about the way causality works.
Your present experience is composed of three things.
One is the results of past actions.
Secondly, your intentions right now, you know what you're intending.
And then finally, or you should know, many of us don't.
And then the results of your present intentions.
All three of these things together go in to create a present experience.
The Buddha now analyzes this in terms of the aggregates.
With each aggregate you have a potential for a sense of form, or a feeling, or a perception, or a thought fabrication, or an act of consciousness.
These potentials come from your past karma.
Now the way you actually experience them as a feeling or a perception has an element of fabrication in it.
You shape these things into your experience.
And then this process of fabrication is what's going to determine whether you're going to be feeling pleasure or pain out of a particular experience.
Just look at your body right now.
You've got certain sensations in the body.
Some of them are not pleasant, or not actively unpleasant, but they're not really pleasant.
Others are more pleasant.
And you have the choice which ones you're going to focus on.
And in making that choice, you can aggravate a really bad pain,
or you can learn how to deal with that pain so that you don't suffer.
And it all depends on what you're bringing to the experience.
So we're never presented with a totally raw, unmediated experience.
We're out there shaping things all the time.
And most of us do it out of ignorance, which is why we suffer from our desires for happiness.
We think that this meat is going to taste really good if we cook it, but then we overcook it.
Or we undercook it and get sick.
And then we decide, meat's not good, I'm going to be a vegetarian.
And then you start getting tofu, and tofu ruins your thyroid. I mean, there are all kinds of things that can happen.
Because we're all thinking we're going to do a good job of fixing this experience.
And it's because we do it out of ignorance, we shape things in all kinds of ways.
Sometimes having pleasure, sometimes finding happiness, and sometimes not.
And so the path of practice that the Buddha is going to recommend to you is that you learn how to do this process with knowledge.
You're aware of what you're doing, and you look at it in terms of the Four Noble Truths.
I.e., is what I'm doing causing happiness, or leading to happiness, or is it causing suffering?
There's so many times where we have other issues at that moment.
And we have a certain preconceived notion about what happiness would be or how it should be attained.
And it's getting in the way of actually looking at what we're really doing and the genuine results of what we're doing.
This process of fabrication that actually is prior to our sensory input comes in three forms.
The first form is physical fabrication, which is the breath.
You shape your experience of the body by how you breathe.
Now, for most of us, never thought of it.
There's a way you can train yourself to breathe that would lead to more or less happiness.
But this is one of the whole purposes of the breath meditation is to find that certain ways you breathe will lead to a greater sense of ease
and well-being in the body, will have an impact on the feelings you're feeling, will have an impact on what's going through your mind.
And so you should bring more awareness to this process of physical fabrication, i.e., the in and out breath.
The second form of fabrication is something called directive thought and evaluation.
In other words, where you're focusing your thoughts and what you're saying to yourself about where you're focused.
Now, different people could come into this room and they'd be seeing all kinds of different things.
Someone with a fashion background would be coming in and kind of rating,
okay, what are all the outfits look like right now?
That's what they would direct their thoughts to, and then they'd evaluate.
No taste whatsoever.
Someone else could come in and they'd be spending all their time focusing on the dust up in the upper corners over there.
Some people would be focusing on the acoustics of the room.
It depends on what you're interested in.
That's where you focus your attention.
That's your directive thought.
That's going to make a huge impact on exactly what you're experiencing as you come in here.
Also, your standards for evaluation.
What would be a good standard for judging the fashion of the attire here today?
Someone might notice that the monks outfit is color coordinated.
See, it's all brown.
Other people might be saying, come on, it's a Saturday morning.
Nobody has to dress up for a Saturday morning Dharma class, okay?
So again, your standards for evaluation would tend to be different.
The third form of fabrication is mental fabrication.
And you see your feelings and perceptions.
The feelings are feeling tones of pleasure, pain, neither pleasure nor pain.
And perceptions are the labels you put on things.
When you see a person, you say person, when you see a clock, you say clock, when you see a sign, you say sign.
And sometimes your perceptions are verbal and sometimes they're images.
The image is, you know, you see somebody and all of a sudden in the back of your mind there's this image, you know, monster.
Another person you see an image of and say, oh, I think someone's really sweet.
No danger at all.
A lot of this has to do with your lizard brain and its reading of the situation around you.
But this is basically how the mind communicates with itself with these little images, perceives the situation.
This is one of the reasons when the Buddha is teaching,
he has so many analogies and images that he has, as you think about,
because that gets deeper into the mind than just the verbal part.
So these are the three kinds of fabrication you're bringing to any situation.
The way you breathe, your thoughts, the directive thought and evaluation that you're engaged in,
your internal conversation about it.
And then the internal conversation in turn is informed by these perceptions you're holding.
If you think this in linguistic terms, perceptions would be individual words
and directive thought and evaluation would be more full sentences that you're making out of the words.
And this is what you bring to any experience.
And so for the purpose of finding happiness,
you want to learn how to bring skillful habits of fabrication into the present moment.
Now this is going to be related to the whole issue of the Brahma Vihara,
is because the way you approach a situation,
if you approach it seeing all beings as potential enemies,
it's going to be impossible to develop goodwill.
But if you have different ideas about what happiness is,
in other words you're going to be fabricating,
thinking about things in a different way and holding different perceptions in your mind,
then it will be a lot easier to have goodwill for all beings.
And this is how your head and your heart work together.
The thinking that you have will change your emotions.
And then your emotions, the feelings you have will in turn change your thinking.
Any questions about fabrication?
Because this is going to be central to the whole rest of the day.
And I want you to keep in mind while we're sitting here talking,
we're going to be engaging, all of us are engaging in verbal and mental fabrication.
This is part of the training, hopefully that goodwill will be easier
when you walk out the room at the end of the day.
So I just want to go back to your comment that only karma determines our experience
or our fabrications.
There's the Sivakasuta and the Samyutinakaya that says,
other factors determine what happens to us.
I think they list bile and phlegm, climate, accidents,
and karma is on that list too, but it seems like it's not so black and white
in terms of what determines our experience.
If you look at this, there's another sutra, and I've forgotten the name of it,
but where the Buddha talks about, the fact that you have a body is past karma.
If you didn't have that body, it wouldn't be subject to bile and phlegm and accidents and these other things.
So the karma is there in the background.
When he's talking to that particular guy, Sivaka,
that list of factors he gives for how we feel pleasure or pain
comes from the medical texts of that time.
That was an analysis.
If you were a doctor then, you would say, let's check for your phlegm,
let's check for your bile, let's check for your wind forces in your body.
Have you had any accidents? Have you been mistreating your body?
I don't know any Western doctors who do this,
but in Thailand they actually keep in mind the fact this person may have some really bad karma
and I can't really cure the guy.
It's not officially on any of the sort of diagnostic lists,
but every doctor I know in Thailand has that in the back of his mind or her mind.
Sometimes I've got a patient here whose karma is such that the disease is untreatable.
So they will recommend to the patient, why don't you go out and make some merit?
Why don't you meditate?
So he's talking to somebody and the person was saying that everybody,
he'd been talking with the Jains and the Jains said all things come,
not just from karma, they said from past karma.
And the Buddha's taking into consideration, no, there is your present karma.
And so when you look at that sutta in the context of other teachings on karma,
you realize everything in that sutta is either a result of past karma or present karma.
So it is this combination of what your experience does come from past karma
plus your present karma, your present intentions,
plus the results of your present intentions in shaping it all together.
So then with this innate quality, that there is no innate quality of mind,
what about from the Anguternikaya, the mind is luminous except for visiting defilements.
The luminosity of the mind is his ability to know, to be aware of things.
There's nothing about it being innately good or innately pure.
The Jamaambu has a really good statement and passage on that.
He's got an old Dharma talk that the radiant mind is unawareness.
So even when the mind is radiant, there's still a lot of ignorance going on there.
What it's referring to is the fact that you can know your actions,
you can know when you are defiling the mind and you can do something about it.
And when the mind hasn't been defiled, it's not permanently stained.
That's what that passage is saying.
Thank you.
Can I talk a little bit about the development of these fabrications?
That's the whole rest of the day.
That's what we're doing.
But essentially what you have to do is develop how you breathe,
how you're thinking about a situation, the perceptions you're bringing to a situation.
And this is what a lot of the Buddhist teachings on how to develop goodwill are all about.
Rethinking the situation.
So you don't feel it found yourself.
One, you don't have to find happiness in the wrong way.
And that's a really important one.
A woman called me one time, she was a student of a Tibetan teacher,
and she was having some problems with her landlord.
Her landlord was trying to sell the place, and he wanted all the tenants to lie about the amount of rent they'd been paying.
And so he was going to them one by one by one and asked him to sign a sheet,
and she didn't know what to do.
And she said, I've been spreading goodwill to him.
I've been envisioning him with a big house and a swing pool and a couple of mistresses and all this other stuff.
I said, no, no, no, no, this is wrong. This is wrong.
If you have goodwill for the guy, you think, may he be virtuous, may he not try to make people lie.
Think of him doing good things rather than just having some wealth up there on Pacific Heights or something.
And then secondly, get together with the other tenants and say, no, we are not going to sign this sheet.
So you have to have an idea.
What is your, how do you visualize happiness?
So these fabrications are then developed in different, say, percentages for each individual based on their past karma.
I mean, some will be, have very maybe strong, directed thought and evaluation,
but have no body awareness or something, or their mental fabrication will be hazy or some other kind of mix.
So everybody does all three of them, but a lot of them are done unconsciously.
You carry certain ways of looking at the world around with you.
And sometimes you're aware of what you're doing, and many times you're not aware at all.
And what we're trying to do in all cases is make you more aware of all three kinds.
The way is to become more aware of all three and then make more and more skillful choices in each of these areas.
Yes. Can I get the mic over there?
I haven't heard the term present karma used before.
Could you say a little more and distinguish past karma and present karma?
Okay, present karma are your intentions right now,
and particularly it starts with your intention of how you're shaping the raw material of your experience
and what you want to do with it, what direction you want to take it in.
And it's actually, and this is one of the problems when we think about karma is that
when the Buddha was talking about karma, that was the main point that he kept emphasizing,
is what you're doing and thinking right now, as opposed to the past stuff.
And the past stuff is something you can't do much about, but you can change your intentions right now.
And that's where he's focusing his intentions.
If nothing else, that's one of the best things to take back with you today.
You want to move that mic down here?
One question about perception and feelings as you're talking about them.
You were saying how we can actually fabricate our own perceptions as well, and the question about that.
So it seems to me, Sanyo is just perceiving something right away.
It happens based on the preconditions that the mind already has.
So it's something that naturally arises from already the state that the mind is in,
but it seems like you're talking about also changing perceptions, which may be another level on top of that.
So can you clarify that?
The word perception in English is a difficult one, because it has two meanings.
One is just the fact that you're taking in data.
And the second one is that you're giving a name to it.
You perceive a dog where there's this pattern of whatever.
And we're talking about the second sense of how you look for things in a particular location.
And it can be trained.
The images that you're holding around in your mind, many times they're there,
and we're not really consciously aware of them until we become consciously aware of the fact that this is causing me suffering.
In other words, because you yourself see that, or somebody else points it out to you.
And then you've got to consciously sit down and say, no, I've got to reprogram things.
And a lot of this happens, the myths that people like to hear or have heard from childhood,
the stories that they were raised with, their parents' attitudes towards the world, those are in their perception.
Their own things that they picked up from their experience.
Going to school, I was hit in the head by a swing, I think my second day in school.
Maybe recess was a dangerous time from that point on.
That kind of thing.
And so again, you have to, sometimes you have to unlearn them and you can sit people down.
This is what the talking cures are all about.
Sit people down and kind of figure out, okay, what are the perceptions you're bringing?
Maybe we can rethink these.
How do you know what evidence do you have that you have unlearned or reprogrammed them
versus repressing the ill will or the perceptions that aren't useful?
Meditation is important here to see the difference between when something is repressed
and when it's simply a committee member you say no to.
Repressing is basically pretending it's not there and pretending that you don't know that it's there.
Whereas simple suppression is saying, I know it's there but I'm not going to follow it.
And a lot of that has to do with your attitude towards the unskillful members of your mind.
If you feel that your identity is threatened by admitting to yourself that there's something unskillful in there,
you will tend to repress.
Whereas if it's okay to recognize, hey, there's something unskillful in here but I don't want to follow it.
And that's healthy suppression.
And meditation because it makes you more alert to what's going on in the mind
and the back room committee meetings that are going on.
Then you can see things.
So here's something, I know it's there.
And developing the attitude, okay, it's okay for unskillful thoughts and a couple things to come up
but we're not going to let them take over.
Hold my mind hostage.
When you're an experienced meditator, do you have fewer unskillful thoughts in the first place?
Yeah.
And the way you can say that you know that is because you've gotten really thoroughly acquainted with your mind.
And you've seen how really nasty it can be.
And you say, this is no surprise.
Is that Mike near Dawn here?
Ajahn, you included Vedana, feeling tone in the category of perceptions.
Can you talk a little bit more about the relationship between Sanya and Vedana and the shifting of Vedana in particular?
Okay.
The Vedana is your feeling tone and that's one of the things that's going to have an impact on your mind.
Now what's going to have an impact on your feeling tone the way you breathe?
So you can breathe in a comfortable way that will help with the actual feeling tone itself
and can create some positive associations with certain perceptions.
Now the other way around of course is that you've got lots of different potential feelings here
and your choice of which one is an important one to focus on is going to be based on your perceptions.
You see a certain stirring in your body and some people would have that stirring and say, I've got to have a drink.
Other people would see a certain stirring in the body and say, I've got to do some breath meditation.
It's a lot of this is based again on past choices you've made and how you associate that particular feeling potential
with an activity or an event.
And so this is why when you're training someone who's an addict you've got to say, let's develop some new habits
and realize that you've got some alternatives.
Is this a process you're also tired of the cultivation of Mehta and the other Brahma Viharas?
Exactly. If there are certain people that you feel strong ill will for you've got to step back and say,
okay, what's the feeling that rises up in me as I see this person?
And then how can I perceive that feeling differently so I don't have to go and punch them?
Okay, we have the first issue of sort of reprogramming your thinking and your perceptions
is understanding happiness in the light of karma.
Okay, basically there are two types of happiness.
There's happiness which is dependent on conditions and there's happiness which is independent of conditions
which can be found through the path.
Now the Buddha teaches the path to both kinds of happiness.
The conditional one of course is the one that's going to be less reliable when you get there.
But he does not discourage people from acting in ways that would create a better situation in life
just sort of on an everyday basis.
However, you should keep in mind the fact that there is this higher level of happiness
and so you don't just settle for being a comfortable person in the Bay Area with a nice, you know,
you've got your practice and you've got all the other aspects of the life that the human potential movement wants you to develop.
There's more.
So it's possible to think that way.
One thing that's very important is it's possible to think that if happiness is a product of what people are bringing to an experience,
it is possible, as I said earlier, for people to find true happiness in a way that doesn't conflict with other people's true happiness.
Because it's all a matter of what's coming from within.
And if happiness had to depend on nice things coming from outside, there's only so much.
And you've got, and the fact of looking for happiness in ordinary worldly ways,
the traditional list is material gain, status, praise, and physical pleasure.
Those kinds of happiness create divisions.
You know, somebody gets the gain somebody else has to lose.
Someone else gets that particular position at work, other people have to lose, you know, be deprived of that.
Whereas the happiness that comes from within is something that doesn't create conflict.
It actually erases a lot of boundaries.
Also, happiness is not a zero-sum game.
That many ways, by looking after your own true well-being, you're actually being helpful to other people in looking after theirs.
There's the analogy, and this is a good perception to hold in mind, of acrobats.
One acrobat on the other acrobat's shoulders.
And the teacher who's on the bottom, he says to the woman up on top,
he says, you look out after me and I'll look out after you and it will come down safely from the bamboo pole.
They would put a bamboo pole vertically and stand on top of that and do their tricks.
And she said, no, that's not going to work. I have to look out after myself, you look after yourself,
and that way we'll protect each other and come down from the pole.
If you think of things in terms of a balance like this, you know, she's not going to be able to maintain his balance.
He can't maintain her balance, but if each of them maintains balance,
it's going to be easier for the other person to maintain balance.
So in this way that in your search for true happiness, it's actually conducive to other people's true happiness too.
Hold that perception in mind so that you don't keep thinking of happiness as a zero-sum game.
It also, however, means that you have to realize that what people are experiencing,
if it's dependent on past karma, present karma mixed together,
there are certain things in a person's past karma you cannot change.
You can't change anybody's past karma.
Where you can be of help is helping them in their present karma.
So when you're thinking about good will for other beings, this is what you're looking for.
What can I do to help them with their present karma right now?
What would be conducive?
Now in some cases it is providing them with food, providing them with just basics of survival.
And beyond that, it has to do with your interactions with them, how you treat them.
There was that great column that Miss Matters wrote several years back.
It says, Miss Matters has a solution to the crime problem.
You talk to all these criminals and one of them says, they ain't giving me no respect.
Now if we learn some respect, we'd have less crime.
And she has a good point.
It's how you treat people.
They gain a different sense of what human beings are like based on your interaction with them.
So it's important to keep in mind that people's genuine happiness really depends on their present karma.
Past karma will have a limiting effect on that, but it also opens some potentials.
In particular, let's think about how each of these four brahmavaharas is affected by that.
One, in terms of metha, there's no question of anyone's deserving happiness or suffering.
The unit of analysis is not the person, it's the actions.
Actions have consequences.
But just because someone has past bad karma, it doesn't mean they have to suffer.
And the Buddha gives the example of someone who's totally developed the mind.
And then here's an image, which is a good perception to keep in mind.
The image is of a broad river full of clear water.
If you put a big lump of salt into the river, you can still drink the water.
Because there's just so much more water than there is salt.
If you took that same lump of salt and put it in a little cup of water, the water would be undrinkable.
Now the river water here stands for a state of mind which has developed the brahmavaharas
and which has also developed an humility not to be overcome by pleasure or pain.
If you have that kind of expansive mind, or can help other people develop that kind of expansive mind,
they're going to suffer less from whatever past bad karma they may have.
So you're not going to question them.
Are you deserving of my compassion?
Because if you have bad past karma, I don't want you.
And anyone who has compassion like that should be thrown out.
When people say that the tijian karma is harsh and impersonal and cruel, they don't understand it.
If you say, okay, I'm only going to be compassionate to people with totally good past karma,
your compassion is not worth anything.
You have to have compassion for everybody regardless of their past karma.
So if everybody were truly happy, the world would be at a better place for everybody.
So if you're truly happy, you're less of a burden on other people.
As for compassion and empathetic joy,
when you're looking at other people, you see someone suffering.
This gets into this issue of should you have compassion for them.
The person who's suffering right now, you don't know their total karmic history.
Some people think that we have one karma account and what we see right now in other people is their running balance.
That's not the case.
The Buddha's image here, and again, here's an image to hold in mind.
It's like a field full of all kinds of seeds.
Some of the seeds are not going to sprout for a while, other seeds are ready to sprout with a little bit of water,
and others are already sprouting.
Some have sprouted and no longer bearing any fruit.
And so what you're seeing right now are the sprouting seeds.
You don't know which of the seeds could sprout with a little bit of water,
but a little bit of kindness and a little bit of compassion,
you can actually help those other persons' seeds sprout.
And it's the same with you.
You don't know what your own potential is right now.
We can't see our karmic past, but we know that if I'm ever in trouble based on some past bad karma I've got,
if I've been kind to people now, that will help alleviate and sort of balance things out.
So you've got this unknown in terms of past karma.
But what you can see is the potentials for you to be helpful to other people when they need to think of that in terms of opportunity.
This is one of the reasons why compassion is not condescending.
Another perception the Buddha has you hold in mind.
When you see somebody who's really, really suffering, remind yourself you have been there.
And whatever karma was involved in that, you've done that karma too.
So we're dealing with people who are just sort of, as the Thai says,
our companions and aging illness and death.
We've got lots and lots of up and downs in our karmic history.
And so when you see someone who's suffering from, at the moment, karmic seeds that are sprouting,
you don't look down on them because they're suffering.
You see this, here's an opportunity for me to be helpful.
This also helps to allay feelings of jealousy for people who have it better off than you.
They're not going to be there forever.
And then the question comes up, suppose you ever get to make it really nice and comfortable someday.
Do you want other people to be jealous of you?
You say, well, a little bit.
No, you don't want people to be jealous.
It doesn't serve any purposes.
So you're not threatened or diminished by other people's happiness.
Hold that in mind because of the karmic complexity of things.
And finally, in terms of equanimity, there are limitations on your ability to change things
when you're dealing with past karma.
And equanimity also saves compassion from burnout.
As you see, there are certain things that you just cannot help,
but you have to say, look, I can't help that.
And then you can focus instead on areas where you can be a problem
so that you don't waste your time and energy banging your head against the wall.
So again, equanimity and goodwill are things that you have to learn how to apply
when appropriate to a particular situation.
And the equanimity is simply a recognition that there are a lot of things in the world we can't change.
No matter how much we want to.
So you say, okay, if I can't change that, where can I change things for a good purpose?
So these are some of the reflections that just keeping karma in mind
teaches us about what it means to have goodwill.
What does it mean to have empathetic joy?
What does it mean to have compassion?
Any questions on that before we break for lunch?
Let's have somebody new.
You mentioned creating good karma as motivation for helping others.
And I find usually when I do something kind for someone else,
karma has no impact on my decision to do anything.
I do it out of a sense of just wanting to help and not considering the repercussions for myself.
Any thoughts on that?
Well, it's some place down in your mind,
where somebody that says, I'm going to benefit from this one way or another, even if I feel better doing that.
That's a good motivation right there.
If you're saying, okay, I want you to come back and be my nurse in the next lifetime, that's not helpful.
But it's good to...
I think part of the problem is there's that Christian teaching when your right hand does good,
and your right hand does not know what the left hand is doing.
In other words, don't let yourself feel good about the good that you've done.
And that creates a lot of miserable people.
And the Buddha says, appreciate the times when you have been good,
so that when you start feeling tempted to do something that's not quite so good,
remind yourself, I really would feel better if I didn't do that.
I really would feel better if I was being more generous.
There are times in the past when you have allowed yourself to feel good about doing something good,
and that gives you more of an impetus, more energy.
And also it helps to prevent the burnout.
When you do something kind to somebody else and they treat you in a horrible way,
show no gratitude whatsoever, and you say, okay,
I'm obviously not going to get the good karma back from that person,
but it's out there in the world now.
Yeah.
Anything else?
Yes.
So in terms of English definitions of metta,
what's most common in this tradition, shall we say,
in the English language, is loving kindness.
And the kindness part on there seems to mitigate a little bit that kind of love,
you know, is a loaded term.
And I just wondered what you think about that definition,
or another one we hear a lot lately is friendliness as a definition of metta.
Friendliness is being a little bit too literal.
To what?
Too literal, because I mean the word metta in Pali is friend.
And metta would be a quality of a friend.
But I think, you know, when we think about somebody being friendly,
they come up, hi, how are you?
And we're here, we're talking about actually wishing for other people to be happy.
Now, many times that means, okay, I'm not going to have anything to do with that person.
You know, the story about the snake is, I tell that because I've had that many, many times with snakes,
and we have rattlers down at what metta.
And it was one evening in particular, I remember,
after I get to recognize the sounds of animals as they go over the leaves.
You know, and there's the bug sound, and there's a little lizard sound, and this is launch.
Snake sound.
And so I opened my eyes, and sure enough, there was a big rattler coming up the hill.
And they said, okay, good will to you, rattler, but please don't come here.
And that's not quite loving kindness.
You be happy wherever you go, but leave me alone, okay?
And that counts as metta as well.
But that would seem like loving kindness, because the kindness is, you know,
if you two have a confrontation.
If I went up and headed it or something, it would not be, you know, it would feel threatened.
But you have kind thoughts in your heart for that snake, even though you want it to go elsewhere.
So I don't see how loving kindness wouldn't apply to that situation.
I'd say kindness. I don't really love rattlers.
I prefer good will, because it really gets down to the point that you're wishing for their happiness.
And you can have good will at a distance, and you can have good will without getting involved with other people.
And you can have good will for people you really intensely dislike.
Well, it fits for the opposite being ill will, which is a common translation.
Like there are certain politicians right now that I would, you know,
it's okay, gotta have good will even for this, okay?
I'm certainly not going to like their policies, but...
We don't want, we're not here to get other people.
We want to visualize them, you know, having their heart attacks or whatever.
Okay, yes.
So the point of karma seems really important in context of Brahma Viharas.
And I wonder like, say when I see someone and I have tremendous ill will for that person.
And say I define that that's probably coming from my karma.
How much sort of control or ability do I have in my present to transform that?
Okay, this is what the contemplations are for.
You see somebody that you really have ill will for.
You say, one, why am I going to gain from that person's suffering?
You say, quite a lot of satisfaction.
You say, no, this is not a healthy satisfaction.
And then sort of reason with yourself.
That's two, if I have ill will for this person and I have to have dealings with this person,
how can I trust myself around them?
And if I want to influence them in a way, let's say we have to have a meeting about something,
somebody at work, say, we have to have a meeting, we have to come to an agreement.
If I'm bringing ill will into the meeting, he's going to sense it.
I've got to do something about that.
So I've got to sit and think.
Okay, this person probably means well, he has some certain good qualities.
And if he has no good qualities whatsoever, you have to feel sorry for him.
And so if part of that is taking you out of the perception that you're being victimized by him,
because that has a lot to do with this ill will, is that this person is being around you, I don't feel safe.
And so I'm not a victim.
Even if he mistreats me, I can protect myself or there are other ways that I can still maintain my own inner calm.
That way I don't have to feel threatened by that person.
So it's a combination of the meditation and then just sitting down sort of thinking the issue through.
Saying, okay, you don't have to like him, but if you go in and think, okay, may you be happy,
may this come out well, I don't want to harm you, but we've got something we've got to agree about here.
And so this is what, it's not so much loving kindness, I just don't wish you ill.
And then very, you know that part of your mind has the ill will, but say, okay, that's influence from past karma.
I don't have to give into that.
I can reason with it.
And if they say, but the guy is awful, okay, even awful people have some good qualities.
I mean, their dogs love them, so they must have something good, you know, whatever, whatever you can think of.
And so there's, because if you just go in, well, this is the way I feel about this person.
If we take your feelings as a given, then you're done for.
But even my feelings are fabricated.
And sometimes the issue may not be that person.
This person may remind you of somebody else and your real issues with the other person.
And say, how would I like it if I was going around in a world where everybody's issues were treating me based on issues they had with other people?
It's not fair.
So you learn how to sort of think your way through.
And it's a lot easier to think your way through when the breathing is calm and comfortable.
This is why, so it's not just a mental exercise, but you're actually trying to embody that sense of well-being.
So if I understand this correctly, would you say that the amount of time you spend wallowing in ill will with practice decreases?
So maybe it might be a month or a day or maybe for some people like a fraction of a second they might have ill will and it might get transformed into good.
With practice, yes.
The amount of time gets reduced.
But it's important that we, again, realizing the importance of present karma.
Just because you've got a lot of past bad karma or past bad habits this way doesn't mean you have to give in to them.
Because you've got, you've got, you say, okay, there are these past bad habits, but I've also got some past good habits.
Let's bring the good habits over and influence the bad ones.
Thank you.
So this field analogy that the Bodhi uses is quite a daunting one.
And you had mentioned that the Buddha taught this path that we could develop the mundane pleasures or the spiritual super mundane pleasures.
Does he indicate anywhere in the canon that, for example, following the path, developing the connections with the Four Noble Truths,
will by and large eradicate more of that or suppress more of those seeds in the field?
It's much suppressed. It's just that when they come up and your mind is a lot more developed, you're going to hardly notice the bad ones.
They're not going to have that much of an impact on the mind.
And you don't have to settle your old karma ledger before you go.
So how is it, I guess that's, in essence, you know, we have a lot of choices to make in life.
And I mean, it could be as simple as, well, I can do an extra hour of meditation or I can, you know, go do some gardening.
I mean, both will have some benefit and some goodness, but is there something to know?
Well, how do I balance? I mean, is always the choice to say put forth the practice?
Do you want the algorithm?
If there one exists.
You have to ask yourself, what do I want out of life?
Yeah, because the Buddha is not placing any imposition on you.
He said, if you want happiness, this is what you're going to do. Then you have to ask yourself, how seriously do I want happiness and how fast?
So basically every moment that you do want to apply, this will be beneficial towards that higher goal.
You don't have to do it, but if you want that, you'll do it.
And you have to remember that the Buddha never defines happiness.
This is one of the interesting things about his teachings is that some basic term, dukkha, is never defined.
Stress, suffering is never defined. Happiness is never defined.
Mind is never defined.
And if you're trying to build a system of thought, of course, your basic principles will never get defined, but this is something different.
Your sense of what constitutes dukkha is going to change as you work on the path.
Your sense of what constitutes happiness is going to change.
Your sense of what your mind is and how it can function is going to change.
So the terms are not pinned down.
When you're translating dukkha, which is the word for happiness and poly, you've got happiness, pleasure, ease, well-being, bliss, all of those things.
So as you refine and change and develop the path more, those refinements will change your ideas of what that happiness is that I am pursuing.
I mean, it's like when I was a kid, I thought hostess, cupcakes, and Twinkies were just the best thing you could do with your money, you know?
And now I can't even conceive eating them, you know?
Okay, I guess we've got a break for lunch.
So we'll meet here at one.
A couple of announcements.
There's a lot of people here.
