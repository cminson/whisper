The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California.

So, warm welcome everyone to Happy Hour.
So, for today's practice, the theme of the Practices of the Heart, I wanted to invite us to explore this amazing, beautiful, powerful, empowering emotion.
That is part of the heart qualities. We usually don't talk about it so much in Happy Hour.
We have talked about it before, maybe a couple of times, I think.
But the topic is all, all, having a sense of all, just can be so supportive for opening our hearts, our minds, to our life, to this precious human birth, instead of, yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, what do I have to do, or whatever.
Just kind of, we go through life often with our eyes closed, sleepwalking, we sleepwalk through this, this amazing, this incredible being alive, being human.
We're so concerned with activities, with the objects of the mind.
We're so concerned about the thoughts that arise, about the suffering that arises, about the peace, about what we want, about the desires, about the pushing away, about wanting.
We're so concerned with all of that, that we become single visioned, single visioned as if we have put blinders on, as if we are in a darkened room with a flashlight.
We're just focusing the flashlight on what we want, what we don't want, what we need to get done, the distractions.
So with awe, we get to turn on the light of the whole room, instead of just turning around with the flashlight, we turn on the light of the whole room and we look around.
It's just, it's amazing, not just at the objects, but the fact that there is consciousness, there is a mind, there is presence, this being, this aliveness that we take for granted.
I mean, it's amazing that anything exists at all.
It's amazing that we exist at all. It's just a miracle. We don't quite, if we really, really sit to think about it, we can't quite understand any of this being existing.
It's such a miracle. It's a quandary that anything exists at all, that we exist, that we can think and cognize and talk and it's just such a sense of miracle.
Even if we have a scientist materialistic perspective, which is great, with that, even with that, it's this miracle of consciousness is just not explained, just cannot be this feeling of being in this body and being alive.
It's so amazing that if we really take it in, we would want to fall to our knees and kiss the ground for just this amazing, I mean, if we were, say, some other animal and then for a little, you know, for a day, we were told,
okay, now you can be human, be human and like, this is amazing. This is incredible.
Whereas we just take it for granted, wake up in the morning, brush our teeth, whatever, whatever.
Anyway, so, awe. And awe can really support us on the path to awakening, on the path to liberation, not suffering, however way putting that works for you.
Because when we get too stuck in our ways, we lose, we lose track of the bigger picture, as if we have this tunnel vision, as I said, as if we're looking through a small hole.
And awe allows us to expand our vision, to expand our vision and be more present for our life.
And we have a more expansive vision, not get stuck so much, not get stuck in what troubles us, etc, etc.
So you'll discover for yourself, I've said enough to set the frame.
So let's explore for ourselves and see what happens.
And one last thing I want to say is, is whatever arises or does not arise, be kind to yourself.
No need for self-judgment, no need for self-judgment, instead of, okay, now I want awe.
Awe needs to come up. Yeah, maybe it doesn't come up right now.
Maybe, you know, it's just like a shy kitty, we encourage it.
Maybe it'll come later, tonight or tomorrow or sometime this week, you're taking a walk in the middle of nature and awe is suddenly you're struck by awe.
So let yourself swim in these teachings, I mean awe may not be on demand, we're just planting seeds, we're just planting seeds, okay.
So with that, let's settle.
Let's rest.
Let's arrive, arrive.
Each moment a new arrival.
In this body,
even if there is unpleasantness,
even if there is pain present,
arriving, arriving
with open arms as if we're embracing or minds embrace,
whatever is,
awe
with fresh eyes,
beginner's eyes in this body as if,
as if you were a Martian,
just now you were allowed this privilege
of stepping into this human body to experience, wow,
what is it like to be in a human body?
This Martian
has a sense of appreciation, novelty, awe for experiencing
all the sensations of this body that is yours.
Hello?
Oops.
Ah.
I'm taking every surprise, every surprise
with a sense of awe.
Every surprise in the mind and the body.
Ah.
Allowing the awareness to connect with the breath.
Breath, out breath.
The miracle of this body,
knowing how to breathe on its own.
Breathing.
Releasing, releasing,
this tension holding thoughts, releasing.
Letting there be ease,
the belly and the limbs and your feet, your sit bones,
shoulders.
Awareness connecting with the entirety of the breath.
Appreciation and awe.
As much as it's available, not pushing, not demanding,
not feeling the soil.
What if you were resting in awe, not so active,
but as if it were a warm pool of water?
Calming, soothing, inspiring.
Holding you, your tired muscle, body working through you.
In whatever ways, in whatever ways,
your heart needs to be touched.
Maybe, maybe this warm pool of water
imbued with awe.
You're resting, relaxing into.
Which you're soaking in, allows your awareness to be imbued with awe.
Know that whatever comes in contact, whatever comes in contact
with awareness, awareness holds, whatever thought, whatever sensation,
there is awe, quality of awe.
Very subtle, but there.
Safe awareness is receiving the breath, the sensations of the breath.
Quality of awe.
Is there receiving?
Awareness imbued intertwined with awe.
Giving the objects of the mind and the body.
Don't try too hard, let it be relaxed, at ease, your practice.
Just sitting and being breathed.
Amazing, the thoughts arise on their own.
Pretty amazing.
The sensations are sensed on their own.
Notice no effort is needed.
It's just happening on its own.
Rolling, rolling on and on.
The feel of experience, sensed and known.
It's just happening on its own.
It's just happening on its own.
If you find mind is thinking, no need for judgment.
Being awe, the thoughts arise on their own, seemingly with no control.
It just arrives, pretty amazing.
Bring awe, not judgment, to your awareness.
It's just happening on its own.
It's just happening on its own.
It's just happening.
It's just happening on its own.
It's just happening on its own.
It's just happening.
It's just happening on its own.
I'd like to suggest some invitations if you'd like to consider this body of ours.
It's made of cells, so many living cells.
That communicate, interact or alive, our immune system and marvel of ingenuity.
Communicating, repairing, remembering.
So many brilliant mechanisms, this body that we don't quite understand, both personally in the state of the art of science.
Our gut filled with so many other bacteria that are helpful.
That we wouldn't be able to live or digest food.
It wasn't for this host of helpful, healthy bacteria that isn't us, not us.
Differentiano.
This body we take, take it to be ours.
It's a miracle of nature, our brain.
All the synapses, the connections, the way it works to neurotransmitters, all amazingly balanced.
Being able to remember, see, act.
Hear, spell, chest.
Amazing, right here.
Instead of focusing on something going wrong with the body, why is it not working? Why do I have pain?
So amazing and incredible that it works as well as it does, it has all these years.
Internally sense of awe, externally sense of awe, magnificent interconnection between so many beings, our lives.
We live because of work, generosity, kindness of so many beings past and present.
Their ingenuity, their service.
And to expand even further.
Looking as if we were looking up into the night sky. We are on this planet called Earth.
So many stars, so many galaxies.
Such an incredible privilege to be alive, to be conscious.
Even for a brief moment in time, to have the opportunity to have agency, to think, to serve, to love, to give.
How awesome is that?
Breathing in awe.
Breathing in awe, opening our hearts to awe.
For this magnificent being who is us, who is me, with intentions, goodness, kindness, in ways we understand and we don't quite understand.
Amazing interconnected work.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
And for the last minutes of this practice period.
Feeling the body, connecting with the breath.
The body, this amazing body knows what to do. Breathing, being alive.
May all beings everywhere, including us, be in touch, at least now and then, with the amazing nature of their minds and their bodies.
To help open up to realization, to awakening, may all beings everywhere be free.
Thank you all. Thank you for your practice.
So, have some time if there are any reflections, questions, comments.
And again, as I said at the beginning, this might be planting seeds.
If all didn't arise, it's okay, you're planting seeds.
One reflection, your comment about walking through life with our eyes closed reminded me of a saying from the Ojibwe.
Sometimes I go about pitting myself and all the while I am being carried across the sky by beautiful clouds.
Oh, that's beautiful. Thank you for sharing that. That is lovely.
I read the quote again from Ojibwe.
Sometimes I go about pitting myself and all the while I am being carried across the sky by beautiful clouds. Yes, great reminder.
Ah, appreciation coming from YouTube. Thank you, you're welcome.
Any other reflections? What might have come up for you in this practice?
Offering it for the benefit of others?
If there are any aha moments, Jamie.
Just a question, Nikki, awe seems to me in some way related to gratitude, but I'm not sure how. Can you comment on the relationship between them?
Yeah, yeah. They're related, but they're not the same actually before you meet or something. Let me ask you, let me turn it back to you.
What comes up for you as you explore this? How is this question coming up? Let's explore it together.
I think that I have more capacity to feel awe if I'm in regular practice of being in touch with gratitude.
Okay, and if you're more in touch with gratitude, it allows you to have awe and more awe, and how do they qualitatively feel different for you if I ask you to?
As much as it's available.
I'll steal something from the writer Annie Lamott. Her paradigm is Christian, but she said that there's basically three prayers which are help, thanks, and wow.
So awe is the third.
Yes, yes, yeah. Nice. Nice. It's not help. It's not thanks, which is the second one, gratitude.
And it's wow. Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. So, so gratitude and awe. So as I feel into my own experience to share, you know, gratitude feels like an appreciation, opening of the heart, a thanking, a,
there's a personal relationship with gratitude. There's a personal relationship that I am grateful for this. I am thankful.
Whereas awe, it takes us out of ourselves. That's perhaps, yeah, this is how I would compare the two.
All it takes is out of ourselves. It's just wow. Wow. Wow. Not for me in mind, but just wow. This is amazing. Whereas gratitude is more personal relationship with gifts and goodness.
So that's something to explore, perhaps. Yeah, thank you.
Deborah says, but there's also a way that after a wow, you often find thanks. Oh yeah, that's true too. There you go. That's yeah. Wow, yeah, could be.
One more reflection here. How does discernment work in this context? It seems like you are allowing everything. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is a very good question.
Yeah, it's, yes, allowing everything, which in many ways actually is, is a sense of, you know, when, when awareness, when Sati is open, there's a sense of opening, open awareness, opening, open.
Don't, don't put away nothing. Don't, don't push away anything. Just open, open to everything. So all allows us, it tells the soil to, for us to open to everything.
Claire says, suggest reading a brief history of time. Yes, that's a great book. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
I see your hand. This is a, your hand is still up. Is that what you wanted to say, Claire? Is there anything else?
You can either unmute or stay muted.
Okay. I think you're not unmuting either you can't or you don't want to hear lips moving.
It's a good to says, is it appropriate to say that all is a sensation, not dependent on thinking? Yes, it is appropriate to say that all is a sensation.
I mean, reflection can bring up all, but it's not dependent on thinking. We can just sit with all without thinking. Claire looks like you succeeded.
I got unlocked here. I have huge technology problems tonight. But the reason I brought I thought of that book immediately when you started the topic, because Stephen Hawking was in such awe of the universe as a brilliant physicist.
But the other thing that was really awesome was that he had Lou Gehrig's disease and he did all this while he was totally immobile. I mean, he could barely speak.
Yet he produced one of the most brilliant books of all time. And to me, that's just an awesome. There you go. There is awe there. Yeah.
And there's a movie of it. If anybody's interested, he did. He also made it as a movie. It's beautiful. Thank you, Claire.
But it was just expressing his awe for what he had discovered in his research. Thanks, Claire. Yeah. So, yes, awe, awe, awe, awe. So, speaking of awe, let's have awe that we have come together here on Zoom and YouTube and listening on audio Dharma leader.
Here we are. These amazing human beings, just like us, want to practice, want to wake up aligning, want to align their heart, their actions with their best intentions.
So as we move to the next part of our time together in small groups, what I would like to ask you is to, first of all, speak from your own experience, not commenting, not managing the group just from your own experience.
Just stay close to your own experience. And you are welcome to say, share what came up for you or hold silent, say pass. Each person has the opportunity to share one nugget.
If 10 things came up for you, just share one and then pass it on to the next person. We'll go reverse alphabetical order and then the next person will say something or we'll say pass and then the next person and then we'll go around and round a few times.
And you can just speak from your own experience, not managing or facilitating. It's a way of sharing. It's a way of sharing your own awesomeness. Even you don't think there is much awesomeness. You are awesome.
You're a human being. This is pretty incredible and holding other people's awesomeness. So I'm going to create the rooms now. And here we go.
Okay. Oh, yes. Einstein quote. This is actually had this as my signature for many, many years. You can live your life as if nothing is a miracle or as if everything is a miracle. Exactly.
So I'm suggesting you live your life as if everything is a miracle because everything is a miracle. So I will open the rooms now. Take care of yourselves. Take care of each other. Here we go.
