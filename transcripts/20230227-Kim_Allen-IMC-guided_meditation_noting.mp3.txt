 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Okay, so let's go ahead and start. Nice to see everyone. So we have probably heard at some point that the Buddhist path is about letting go. And this is true. But there is a lot packed into that little phrase. What are we letting go of? What is the act of letting go? So letting go is actually quite multidimensional. It's sometimes volitional and sometimes not. Sometimes we need to go toward or into what we're aiming to let go of. And sometimes we need to pull back from it. Sometimes we actively engage and sometimes we just watch. So in the series this week, we're going to be exploring seven methods for letting go that are useful on the path. And all of these methods hinge in some way on discernment. You know, what is the best way to let go of this, whatever is happening? So that's just a brief taste and we'll get into that more. But for now, let's go ahead and start sitting together. So finding a spot that's comfortable where you'll be able to sit for a half hour or so. Just allowing yourself to settle in to your spot. If it's comfortable to do so, you can close your eyes and really allow your attention to come inward. Just sensing the body sitting. And you'll be consciously settling back a little bit. Sometimes looking at a screen, we can lean forward. So just settling back so that the posture feels very upright if you're sitting. And relaxed, allowing your spine to be straight. Maybe beginning by sensing the place where you're sitting. Or if you're lying down in your place where you're lying against the bed or couch. Just allowing that to support you, feeling the support of what you're sitting on, building your in and ultimately the earth. Just holding this up. Softening. Softening into the body. So softening the muscles of the face. Around the eyes, around the mouth. The eyes themselves in the eye sockets, letting those be soft. And then the jaw. The place where the spine meets the skull, letting that open. So the neck can release. And down through the shoulders. I think those naturally drop, maybe the shoulder blades slide down the back. And letting the openness of the chest. Down into the belly area, letting that be soft. Maybe feeling the spine in the middle and letting both the belly and the muscles of the low back fall away from the spine. Softening through the hips, down into the legs. Sensing that the hands and feet are relaxed and open. All of this is an invitation to the body, but of course if the body still has tension or if there is some pain today, that's fine. That's fine, the body just is as it is. So just inviting some ease also in the mind. Bringing the mind also into the present moment. The sense of releasing ideas about the past or concerns about what we need to do after this or what might happen. And being willing just to be here for this time. So establishing mindfulness. And allowing the attention to naturally move to the sensations of breathing. Often when the body is softened and the mind has been brought to the present moment, the clearest sensations are in the breath coming in, going out. Just allowing that simple awareness to come into the forefront of attention. So the invitation in this sitting, if you'd like, is to do a very simple meditation. It's a very simple practice that many of you will know that's called noting. So that means applying a simple gentle label to experience in the present moment, like breathing in or hearing. Or if there are thoughts, thinking or planning. And it's not anything that we think about. We just go with the first label. And if a word doesn't come, then you just skip that one and label the next one. And the practice is really to help the mind know what it's doing and what's going on in experience. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And if the mind has wandered away, And if the mind has wandered away into thinking, that's fine. We just gently note thinking. And then continue with whatever happens next after that. Just gently be in touch with the normal flow of different experiences that we have. Can be helpful to keep the breath in mind as an anchor or a stable presence. At least to return to. But with the noting practice, we acknowledge that there are other things, sounds and body sensations and thoughts and such. And that's all part of the meditation. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Just seeing what's in the mind and the body will tend to have a stabilizing effect. We continue to note something that's difficult. May still be there, but we're able to be with it. We continue to note something that's already peaceful or happy, tends to stabilize it and increase the sense of nourishment that comes from it. This is the effect of gentle present moment seeing. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Looking into your mind as to what's going on in the general flow of experience, has there been any shift in the course of this, it's perhaps an increase in wholesome qualities. Sometimes people think, oh no, not what I've been seeing in my mind. But sometimes we forget that mindfulness is a wholesome quality. So to the degree that we've had that and noticed that the mind is coming more wholesome over this time. And just sensing how you feel now as we near the end of the sit, in the mind, in the body. We may get the sense of the protectiveness, protective quality of mindfulness. The way if we know what's happening in our experience, then we're less likely to get caught up or go down a rabbit hole or move in a direction that's going to be harmful for ourselves or others. How powerful it is just to know and what a gift it is to the world to have some degree of awareness and some ability to direct our attention. So simple and so powerful. So being happy with this blessing that we can offer through our attention.
