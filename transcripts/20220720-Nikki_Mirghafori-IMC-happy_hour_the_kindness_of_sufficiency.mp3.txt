 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. There. Great. Okay. So, hello. Hello and welcome everyone. Whether you're joining us on Zoom, many of you are, and also those joining on YouTube. Hello, greetings, welcome to this rendition of Happy Hour. So, so would the theme I'd like to invite us to practice with today is relating to metta, relating to warm heartedness, offering safety, offering goodwill, offering goodness. Is, is how a sense of enoughness, just bringing a sense of it's enough, it's enough, it's okay, it's enough, it's enough, this is enough. I'm enough in this moment. Just showing up is enough. Maybe you've had a hard day, it's been a long day. And just showing up sitting in Sangha, or maybe if you're listening to this audio later on your own, just showing up, making an attempt. This is enough. This is enough sense of comfort of not always driving ourselves ragged more and more and more. It's okay, opening up to the enoughness of this moment. Enoughness of this amazing being who is ourselves and is doing their best. This is enough. And maybe through this acceptance of the enoughness or rather the plenty of this moment. We can appreciate and see and really touch into this care, this sense of care, this sense of holding ourselves, this non-judgment. The sense of enoughness actually is the opposite of self-judgment because self-judgment is not, oh, that's not good enough. You're not good enough. This is not good enough. You should be doing this, that, or not be doing that. It's okay, sweetheart. It's okay, dear heart. It's enough. Ah, sense of solace, calm. So metta, warm heartedness, loving kindness, showing up in this other, wearing the clothes of, it's enough. This is enough. It can be a very soothing, calming metta, not necessarily very energized or energetic. So as you know by now, you're maybe you're getting to know that metta, loving kindness can show up in practice in so many ways. It can wear many, many, many different beautiful guises. So this is one way in inviting us to explore it. It's not very energetic, but very calming. It becomes more similar, more expressive of itself, similar to equanimity. This is a calming, soothing, because of course equanimity, upekka is a practice that's one of the brahma viharas, one of the four heavenly abodes. Metta being the first one, equanimity being the fourth one, they're related. Of course, they're related. So this way of, ah, this is enough. It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. It's expressing, metta expressing itself, its similarity or its relationship with equanimity in this way of showing up, in this nuanced way, comforting way of showing up. So that's all I want to say to set up the space for our practice together. So, so let's, let's meditate together. Let's meditate. So I'd like to invite you to land in your posture, whether sitting, standing, lying down. And if it's comfortable for you to close your eyes, softening, relaxing this body. Whatever is present in this moment, opening up to it, could be a lot of energy present. There could be lack of energy, fatigue, perhaps, the end of the day. Achiness present in the body. Maybe there's excitement about this period of practice taking refuge together. Allowing the breath to move through. The breath to breathe you, showing up in the abdomen. And wherever there is tightness. Maybe lower back. Or your forehead. Or your forehead. And write the breath to move through and calm. Soon. Like a soothing ointment, ointment to whatever might be tight in the body, in the mind, in the heart. And the thoughts are arising. It's okay. It's all right. It's what minds do. Offering that, oh sweetheart, dear mind, this moment is plenty. There is so much here. There is no need to try to entertain the thoughts of the future, the past, regrets. This moment is plenty. It's enough. Let's rest, dear heart. Let's rest. Let there be kindness, not judgment, not kicking the mind for thinking, but inviting it to appreciate how much goodness there is here in this moment of just sitting. Being breathed, being silent, contented, such exquisite training, such exquisite way of being, simple enough. Thank you. At any point, noticing the mind, the heart, wants to wander, is trembling to dart here and there again with kindness. Oh sweetheart, it's okay. This moment is enough. See, there is so much here. This moment is more fulfilling with kindness, with spaciousness, than darting to the past future. Rest, rest. Be cared for. Dear heart, dear mind, right here with the lullaby of the breath. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Now besides comforting the mind, the heart at this moment is enough. There is so much here in comfort, in refuge. It can also bring in, if you wish, that just showing up, however you're showing up with your intention, that this is enough, that showing up is enough. As if you're knocking on the temple door, this proverbial temple door of peace is awakening, just showing up is enough. Let the body have ease, be relaxed and soft. Let the breath, soothing, calming, connecting you to the present moment, this breath. I can anchor into the ocean of now. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And maybe now then drop in the word enough or plenty. This is enough. This is plenty. This right here, whatever this means, this showing up, this being who is me, this moment, this body, this opportunity, all these gifts of the present moment. Let there be kindness, as if your fairy godmother is showing you the enoughness of your heart, enoughness of everything with kindness. And if the mind or heart, the body at any time becomes pitulent, the fairy godmother is caring, loving, eternally patient, this is enough, please see, shows you. All the things maybe you haven't seen or are taking for granted. All the things that you haven't seen or are taking for granted. All the things that you haven't seen or are taking for granted. All the things that you haven't seen or are taking for granted. All the things that you haven't seen or are taking for granted. All the things that you haven't seen or are taking for granted. And notice the mind that feels scarcity. This is not good enough. I want to do something. Are you failing? Your mind is wondering, this is not good enough. Notice that mind. And love it. Your spirit, kindness, safety, it's okay, it's all right. Your mind that wants something else, it's okay, it's all right. The fairy godmother of this moment loves everything that's arising. Even the mind of scarcity. Offered kindness. Goodness. Let it relax. And feeling pushed out. All the things that you haven't seen or are taking for granted. you And you're welcome to experiment. There is a particular angle of insufficiency about yourself or present or what you have, what you do. You can try different incantations of enough sufficiency. I have enough or I do enough. I am enough. It's my intentions, my wholeheartedness, my goodness to really turn the mind to see the good. Again, not a practice of complacency, but to really see sufficiency. Sufficiency, which can still leave room for aspiration, but let's turn towards sufficiency, to see the plenty so that the heart feels replenished and it's plenty. This is enough. This is plenty. And woman said, oh, well, I've got a choice. And woman took it away. you you What happens if you nourish your heart for just a moment? If you've been in your heart for just these few minutes insufficiency, be curious. What might happen? You can always go back to insufficiency, but just right now, what happens? It's hard to feel insufficiency in this moment. You can always go back to insufficiency in this moment. You can always go back to insufficiency in this moment. Whatever arose or did not arise during this practice period, it was enough, more than enough. And we see it, can we appreciate it with gratitude or whatever it was? Ah, exhaling into sufficiency, into completeness, I've done my best. Trusting that seeds of contentment have been planted, of kindness, they will flower. The time that we least expected. May all beings everywhere, may all beings everywhere know their own goodness, their own sufficiency. May we too, may we wake up to our goodness, our completeness, our fullness, together with all beings everywhere. Thank you all for your practice. We have time, there are questions, reflections, reports from the field. You're welcome to type in chat, if it's just to me, private, I won't read your name, it's to everyone. I will read your name also, you can raise your zoom hand, if it's your physical hand, I will not see you. And you're invited to offer any reflections, any aha moments, any challenges, anything, as a gift, as a gift to others. One of you says thank you fairy godmother. You're welcome. All your fairy godmothers are welcome. Yes, Fred, please. Thank you, Nancy. I find it relatively easy to think, certainly I have enough in the material side of life, and in the many ways that that plays out. But as I come back to feeling, am I am I enough now am I sufficient in my aspiration and my, my efforts to be as I want in the world to be more open to be more loving to be engaged in useful ways. The answer is no, I'm not. And I think you're asking us to simultaneously maintain to contradictory ideas that to not let go of aspiration and effort, but perhaps to also say well, you know, that's one can aspire and still some peaceableness in the present effort. Exactly Fred right on and you put it so eloquently. Thank you. That's exactly it and don't mute yourself just yet. It's, it's like the Suzuki Roshi famous line, you are perfect as you are, and you can use a little improvement. How is that that's exactly the intention, because there needs to be a sense of because the, you need a little improvement alone. It brings tightness in the heart and the mind as you know and there's a sense of insufficiency and lacking and and envy and or shame or whatever it's like it's not conducive. So there needs to be a sense of, I'm enough, but there's enough in this there's a sense of sufficiency gladness goodness that the heart can feel settled and rested in, so that it can be. So that it can aspire for further goodness. Exactly. Yeah, right on. Thank you. Thank you. Not easy to do. It's not and yet I so appreciate that you verbalized for the you really brought out what what the intention was here so I really appreciate you for doing that. Thanks, Fred. Yeah. Yeah. Couple of reflections here. Christine. If not this breath, the sitting here, this opening to life, we have refused again and again until now until now. David white. Oh yeah, beautiful. I love that poem. I think I've seen that poem before. Had I remembered, I would have brought it in, but thank you for bringing it in. This is perfect Christine. Thank you. Well, that's lovely. And maybe Neil would also share that poem later in the Google mailing list. Google groups. Fazl says thank you for that question Fred that's been on my mind. Yes, thank you Fred. That's great. Pat says, such a relief for the practice of just enough after a long involved day. Yeah, sometimes it's. Yeah, appreciation coming. Thanks, Fred. Thanks Christine. I think you send that just to me, not to the group this was private so if you want to send it to everyone you're welcome to. Nadine I just saw your hand. Yeah, so I just something kind of funny happened when I'm, you know, pushing thoughts away, just being present. The thoughts are always kind of words in my mind, or I just I'm talking to myself. And suddenly my mind just shot me a picture. And I thought, Oh sneaky mind, what a sneaky mind. It's like you're not talking to you shot me a picture and I, I should push that away to that was the first time I have my mind ever tricked me with a picture. Hmm. Hmm. That's interesting. It's, it's cute. Many minds do that. So here's here's an invitation I haven't been so. So, when all the thoughts come and also if pictures come again now that the mind is presenting because it's not unusual. See what happens if you shift your position from pushing it away, you know your hand gesture was also like this pushing it away. Instead of welcoming it. See what happens if you do that. Oh hello dear mine. Hi sweetheart you come sit down. Come see there is so much plenty there's so much goodness here so so see if you just shifted around see what happens be curious. Does that make sense, what I'm suggesting. Maybe it'll send me a pretty picture. Thank you. It's all just bring it here, come, come here, it's okay. Because that's that pushing that movement of the heart that movement of the mind which actually you represented beautifully and that that can actually create more involvement in thinking that that energy, so I'm inviting to bring more. Just more care more attention more love to that movement, it's not needed, make it this make it. Yeah. And it's not about giving into thinking and ruminating, but it actually shifts the dynamic. And I invite you to be curious about that. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. So, one last reflection. This one is private. Thank you Nikki I have been in a lot of emotional pain over the past 24 hours, many feelings of worthlessness and inadequacy. This practice really helped soothe me. Thank you for sharing that. Yeah. May it provide comfort and to see the goodness within your here you're practicing there's so much goodness here already so much goodness. So, so dear ones, let us turn our attention to practicing in small groups and small breakout groups. We have roughly size three, and here are some invitation so please listen up, especially if you're relatively new to happy hour. So the invitation in the groups is you speak only from your own experience. You don't ask questions you don't direct, you don't manage the group, you just offer a nugget from yourself. So pay attention to what is appropriate to say or not to say. What's too much to say. And you're also always welcome to say pass and hold silent space, that's okay too. The next person will say something and then the next person and they'll come back to you so make your, your piece. Pretty short, just one nugget of thought, it's not a long monologue, it's just one nugget of thought that the next person the next person come round and round, and be kind to yourself and especially kind to others, holding each other with care with appreciation with metta. These are your siblings in practice. Take care of each other. Take care of yourselves. Yes, speak in reverse alphabetical order tonight. And I'm going to open the rooms. Take care of yourselves. Take care of each other. Here we go. The rooms are closed everybody's back welcome back everyone. And I realize it's exactly seven o'clock so we're right on time. Since we had such lovely reflections before went into the group. If there any last minute reflections, feel free to type them in chat. Otherwise, maybe we'll bring our session to a close. Thank you all for your practice. Thank you for showing up. May we all know recognize our goodness, our enough in this that we're perfect just the way we are, and that we need, we can we can use a little bit of improvement, may all beings be well may all beings be happy, including ourselves. Here we go. Thank you all. Be well. Now I stopped there.
