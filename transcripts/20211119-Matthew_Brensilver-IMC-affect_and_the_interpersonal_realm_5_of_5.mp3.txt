 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So we'll continue with our theme for the week. A group of prominent emotion scientists, neuroscientists, wrote a piece recently in a journal, prominent journal, titled The Rise of Effectivism, Effect, Feeling, Rise of Effectivism. There was behaviorism, which was oriented around conditioning and reinforcement, reward, punishment, and then a cognitive phase, you know, where a lot of the attention was around memory and attention and perception. And now they suggest maybe we're in a phase in this cognitive science realm of affectivism, valence, emotion, empathy, mood, motivation, stress, well-being. So they write, the behavioral and cognitive sciences have faced perennial challenges of incorporating motions, feelings, motivations, moods, and other affective processes into models of human behavior in the human mind. Such processes have long been marginalized or ignored, typically on the basis that they were irrational, unmeasurable, or simply unenlightening. However, it's become increasingly difficult to deny that these processes are not only linked to well-being, but also shape our behavior and drive key cognitive mechanisms such as attention, learning, memory, decision-making. Emotions do not just shape how we interpret the world, but also shape which aspects of the world need our attention and which can be safely ignored. Emotions are not just about what is, but also about what matters. So, so much hinges on feeling, so much hinges on feeling. And in this interpersonal world, interpersonal realm that's been our focus, it's so vital that we become deeply acquainted. There are, there are, of course, thoughts and perception and sights and sounds and tastes and other sensations. But feeling is the linchpin. Ajahn Sajjhuta says, all dhammas converge on feeling. All dhammas, all, in this context, all phenomena converge on feeling. And experience largely becomes meaningful because of feeling. Experience becomes meaningful because of feeling. Motivation depends on feeling. The sense of urgency depends on feeling. And each feeling state announces a kind of command. Do something, say something, think something. And so we have to develop a kind of wise, clear, loving relationship with our feeling life. And this is, nowhere is this more apparent than in enjoying and navigating the interpersonal realm. So evolutionary psychiatrist niece says, emotions are specialized modes of operation shaped by natural selection to adjust the physiological, psychological, and behavioral parameters in ways that increase our capacity and tendency to respond adaptively to threats and opportunities. And there are, there are always threats and opportunities being with others until some threat and opportunity. I can't remember that line we started with from Lisa Feldman Barrett that the best thing for a human nervous system is another human and the worst thing for a human nervous system is another human. We are navigating subtle or more demonstrable threat and opportunity. This means that our feeling life is very prominent in the interpersonal realm. And while emotion is designed for to promote evolutionary fitness, that's very different from saying that it's designed for enlightenment. There are some things that yeah, we flow with the stream of our own biological conditioning and other things we go against the stream. And so we, we need deep emotional wisdom for to tolerate the dependence of love, the surrender that I was speaking about yesterday. The, the increasing riskiness of entrusting our heart to another can torque our mind in a lot of different ways to open our heart to another entails a willingness and courage to to grieve all that is precious and dear to me as of the nature to change. Colleague. Our ability and willingness to see and be seen. And we need profound emotional skill to be on disguised in our strength and our poverty. Wisdom, an equanimity is required to fully enjoy pleasure, not to pinch our pleasure because it feels wild or exposed, or somehow cuts against our notion of restraint. And yet we often, often talk about equanimity with craving. And that's one thing that's vital. But what is equanimity with pleasure itself. It does not mean to squash it, it does not mean to not enjoy it, and it does not mean to be worried about getting attached. What, how do we bring this kind of skill with feeling, so as not to suppress or get entangled. We need wisdom to navigate the inevitable challenges and frustrations and disappointments. Of idealization of disillusionment of reconnecting to some warmth, the tolerance of ambivalence, ambivalence, this kind of one way of thinking about Dukkah about suffering is, it's about ambivalence. We need emotional skill to recognize that the other can never be the end of your seeking. Other people in our lives can do so much some things that only another can do. And the other cannot be the end of seeking. Wanting, in other words, is always different from getting. We need emotional skill to be wrong. There's so much so much shame about being wrong, and we're wrong so much. Sometimes you maybe you know those moments you, you kind of know you're wrong maybe you're having a conversation with somebody important to you. And, and there's like that that subtle little voice of just like, Yeah, I kind of know I'm wrong right. But the prospect of the shame of, of kind of acknowledging it is just too much so we like, double down, you know, even though we know we're bluffing right. Just dig in. I was always inspired by something Sylvia Borstein said when she said like you know when I realize I'm wrong like, I'll just like pull up right out of the moment, just mid sentence and just say, Yeah, I'm wrong. I'm sorry. This doesn't feel right. You know it's like you can feel that you're about to like, redouble dig back into your emotional stance and like the courage of just like mid sentence, you know, Wait a second. Take skill, yeah. Skill, emotional skill. You need skill. Amidst all of these realms of feeling interpersonal realm. Sajin Sajito. If it's properly cultivated the body can provide a mooring post it's the ground the stabilizer. It's how to discharge energy. All that push of the mind sends a lot of energy into the system. Sometimes you can get quite heated or feel very heavy tense tight disoriented. That's what's happening. What's happening is all that that Vena and Sankara are pushing and driving churning up energy. The body knows how to discharge the mind doesn't not by itself. This is how you allow the discharge to happen. Relax. Open the palms of the hands open the soles of the feet. Relax the jaw. Open the temples of the head. Sock it to the eyes and the forehead. Drop your shoulders. Listen your belly. You begin to see that those mental emotional psychological patterns have a body correlation. And you work on their bodily aspect. It may not give you clear solutions as to why you feel this way what you're going to do with the rest of your life. How you're going to sort out this person and so forth. But it will tell you how to stop suffering. As we develop more wisdom, patience, equanimity around feeling. This is also deepens our empathic capacity that when we resolve, bring a higher resolution to our inner life or inner feeling life. We can perceive in much richer detail the inner life of others. This of course is helpful to. So I offer this for consideration. Yeah, thank you. So we'll complete this intensive tomorrow, day long at 930 Pacific. And yeah, we'll sit and practice and have some time in silence and some time for offer reflections and we can have some dialogue and. Yeah, sort of open some of the some of the threads that began here. And yeah I realize I'm if you, you want to volunteer as a co host. I might need some help, because I can't disable it's too late for a passcode and I can't disable the chat, the, the waiting room so if you want to take a shift for an hour or something letting people in from the wait room. Just chat me tomorrow morning that's appreciated. And, yeah, look forward to to actually seeing some of you I appreciate the, the chance I see things going, and will be nice to see your, your faces tomorrow if you join. For DJing in the background and I wish you a good, good day.
