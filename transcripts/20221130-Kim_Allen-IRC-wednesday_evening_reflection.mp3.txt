 There's an image or a metaphor called the Dharma Rain and that's kind of the way we take in the Dharma. And it has two qualities. One is that the Dharma Rain falls equally on all beings. It doesn't choose, there's no exclusion or exceptions. Everything just gets covered evenly by this sweet Dharma Rain. And then the second quality is that the beings that are touched by the Dharma Rain, they just take in what is needed. Just the way each of the plants that gets rained on with water will absorb just the amount that it needs. And what it doesn't, it just lets run off. This is a poem called Lingering in Happiness. After rain, after many days without rain, it stays cool, private and cleansed under the trees, and the dampness there, married now to gravity, falls branch to branch, leaf to leaf, down to the ground, where it will disappear, but not, of course, vanish, except to our eyes. The roots of the oaks will have their share, and the white threads of the grasses and the cushion of moss. A few drops, round as pearls, will enter the mole's tunnel, and soon so many small stones buried for a thousand years will feel themselves being touched. So we offer these words in the teachings that can sound very big. Faith and gladness and joy, tranquility, happiness. There's sort of no need to try to make them happen or fit into them, worry whether they're happening. They're more like the Dharma rain, and they will be taken in, we trust that they'll be taken in, to the parts of our being that need them in just the right way. And maybe, without our even thinking about it, they're channeling down into our heart, moistening some area that we didn't even know was dry. And we can trust that our being will take in just what is needed in just the right way of this Dharma rain on this retreat. So I hope it's a beautiful, easeful night, just letting what you've heard absorb. Have a beautiful night.
