Practice Note : Meditation Attitudes

In terms of the Dharma and the practice we do, there is 
the particular  technique  or approach  that you’re using 
when you meditate, and there is the attitude in which 
you do it. For example,  the technique might be  focusing 
on the breath. Or it might just be general mindfulness of 
whatever is happening in the present moment. Or the 
primary technique  might be loving -kindness meditation. 
No matter what meditation practice you do, there  are a 
number of attitudes that might come into play when  you 
do it. It’s very important to be the custodian or the 
caretaker of your attitude, because if you don’t take care 
of your attitude, then something else will [laughs] . That 
something else might not be the best attitude  to have.  
 
One of the reasons it’s important to have a good attitude 
when we meditate is that a lot of meditation  is about 
failure , especially befo re you get settled down . You sit 
down , and you’re going to stay with your breath . Then 
the mind goes off ; it doesn’t stay on the breath. You 
could call that failure, right? You set yourself to do  
something , and you don’t do it. So you bring the mind 
back. Or you’re doing loving -kindness practice , and 
before you know it , you’re thinking about your shopping list. You’ve lost track of your practice , and you have to 
come back.  
 
There  are all kinds of attitudes that can come with the 
mind not going along with the program. You can feel 
bad about yourself . You  can get angry  or discouraged. 
A lot of these more negative attitudes undermine what 
you’re trying to do. So I think it’s really helpf ul to spend 
a little bit of time considering what would be a helpful 
and sincere attitude to bring into the practice. You don’t 
want to artificially create something. But I think if you 
consider it , you might have a fairly good chance of 
finding something in your repertoire of attitudes and 
understandings that would help you have a more 
positive attitude to what’s going on.  
 
One attitude that Buddhism encourages is kindness, 
benevolence, good will , or loving -kindness . So, for  
example , when you notice the m ind wandering off the 
breath into thoughts, a kinder way to respond  is to go, 
“Of course, this is what minds do,” instead of , “Oh no” or 
some negative equivalent  – and then come back to the 
breath. Your job is to come back, and not to go , “Of 
course” and j ust continue  being elsewhere . But, “Of 
course, this is what minds  do,” and then come back. It’s 
not a big problem or mistake, but just a matter of fact.  
 
An attitude that I like is , in a certain way , not to agree 
with everything that happens , but to have an attitude of “Yes,” rather than “No, not that.” It’s like an 
acknowledgement of , “Oh yes, that’s how it is now.” 
There is openness or kindness, “not a problem -ness ” – 
“Yes, this is how life is. This  is how it manifests right 
now, and given that this is how it is, and that i t is not 
useful or helpful to continue this way, let me come back 
to my breath and the present moment. Let me come 
back to my loving -kindness practice.”  
 
As you do the practice tod ay, you might try to look at 
your attitude. See what your native attitude is when 
you’re left to your own devices . Then  see if you can 
bring  some nice attitude that’s more helpful, such as,  
“Of course ,” or “Oh yes, that’s how it is” – some kind of 
“Yes.”  But “Yes”  does not mean to continue being  
distracted.  
 
There is a  kind of opening to possibilities in the attitude 
of “Yes, that’s how it is . Now  given that’s how it is, let 
me center myself again back on the breathing and 
continue.” I find it’s a lot easier to continue with the 
practice when there’s an attitude of “Yes”  – an 
openness, kindness, or “ of course -ness. ”  
 
When the attitude is “No,” it’ s kind of closing something 
down. My experience is this actually gives more fuel to 
the part of the mind that gets distracted. So, I’m actually 
more likely to wander off or get concerned or preoccupied if I have the attitude of , “Oh no, not this ! 
This is t errible, and I’m a terrible person for having this.”  
 
I hope that helps. You might explore that today. And if it 
doesn’t help at all, then figure something else out  
[laughter] .
