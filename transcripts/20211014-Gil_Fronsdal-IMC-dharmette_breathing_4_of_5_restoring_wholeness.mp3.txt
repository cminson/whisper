 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Continuing on the theme of breathing, mindfulness of breathing for this week. It's a remarkable experience to be at the birth of some mammal, animal, or human being. And to witness the first breath. And the first time I saw that was the birth of a calf. And I don't know what was going on with a calf, but it certainly didn't look alive when it came, when it was born, came out. But at some point it took a breath, and the eyes opened, and there was life. Sometimes life is marked by the first breath, then marked by the other end, marked by the last breath, the last exhale. And in between we have a lifetime of breathing. But each breath is a kind of in-breath, is kind of a beginning. Each out-breath is kind of a, something comes to an end. And in that rhythm there's a kind of renewal, there's a kind of rebirth that goes on. And one of the aspects of mindfulness of breathing is how this kind of rebirth, or this restoring that goes on. And the theme for today is restoring. And as people settle into meditation, and settle into just being with the breath, then they are no longer scattered, distracted, preoccupied, no longer caught up in their, whatever drama is going on in their life. Not to disrespect the drama, but no longer scattered by it or disconnected from it. But the whole psychophysical system begins to get organized, healed, the jigsaw puzzles come back together and get settled. There's a restoration of health, spiritual health, or kind of psychological health. That, to call it psychological, maybe implies a little bit too much, just the mind. But it's very embodied, a sense of embodied health. And that can happen even when the parts of the body are sick. And now it's a different kind of health than what we usually think of as physical health. So this physical health, and this psychological health, or spiritual health, and it can feel like, this is what's healthy, this is what's normal, this is, when we settle into meditation, some people, and I've had this experience where this feels like the most healthy, appropriate, nice way of being. And whereas the ordinary daily life can feel, that's what feels extraordinary. That's what feels like an altered state compared to what's the healthy state, or the, it feels like a really normal state. The healthy, normal state, oh, this is really what life can be about. And it's kind of like if you've been exhausted from working a lot, then you take a nap or sleep, and you wake up and you feel, ah, I'm restored. And so in the same way, as we allow ourselves to settle into meditation, and the ordinary concerns of life fall away, and we're just here focused simply on the breath, but not focused on a way that's tight or constricted or greedy for something. But it's more this sense of allowing, respecting, making room for our experience. Almost like getting out of the way, but not getting out of the way so that we are no longer connected and attentive, really attentive to the breathing, to our experience. Allowing it to wash over us, allow the breathing to kind of occur so the breathing can restore itself, so the breathing can find its way into some kind of healthy and healing. So that, and with the breathing, because the breathing is so interconnected to our emotions, our body, our thoughts, our psychology, our intentions, the whole phenomena of it feels like, like it moves to health, it moves to wholeness, to harmony, to, and one of the wonderful feelings is to feel, to sense, now this is normal, this is what the ordinary is like. And stress, stressful mind that with people ordinary living under, that's not the ordinary, that's the extraordinary, that's losing touch with the normal, the healthy. And so there's a restoration that goes on. And that is not a restoration that is only about letting go of things, but it's also about allowing something to grow, allows me to cultivate, something to spread and develop and kind of be here for us. So the, I call it the restoration. And it's a restoration where independent of Buddhist ideas of deep letting go, independent of ideas of not-self or independent ideas of emptiness or kind of disappearing somehow in awareness, all kinds of things that can happen. And if those things are overemphasized, then sometimes it feels like we're subtly, or maybe not so subtly, diminishing the definitively, the clarity, the value of being a human being. And the restoration process of meditation is, is, is a, is an important part of this process that we're allowing yourself to become whole, harmonious, allowing things to settle, to drop away so that there can be this emerging of a kind of inner confidence and inner strength and inner definitiveness that feels like everything's in harmony and peaceful in such a way that if there is conceit, if there is a diminishing ourselves or a kind of denying part of ourselves, you can feel how that, the effect of that is, is, is stressful, is off, is not quite right because it's a loss of the harmony, it's fragmenting again. And so we can't get too caught up in, we can't have conceit, but we also can't have devaluing. There's a kind of a embodied restoration of wholeness that can happen. And maybe this language I'm using is too strong, too implies maybe it has to have kind of, you know, you know, some strong way of being. It's kind of gentle also. It's kind of sneaks up on us. It's not something you can force or insist on or spend a lot of time looking for. But as we just stay with the breath and let go of our thoughts, let go of the ways we diminish ourselves or fragment ourselves and just settle in and allow, allow, allow the breath to breathe itself, allow the breath to breathe through the body, allow the body to breathe, allow the whole experience, everything to come into awareness. You might find that there's a shift and a settling and a movement towards healing and wholeness and fullness that happens. And to start getting a sense of that can give a lot of confidence that we, a lot of confidence in the value of not prioritizing our neurosis, not prioritizing our suffering, not prioritizing our challenges and our difficulties. And saying it that way, not prioritizing it, that it's not meant to deny that these things exist or to push them away or say that they're not worthy of attention. They are worthy of the whole. They are worthy of being recognized. But there's a strong tendency to over-prioritize those, to limit ourselves and to narrow our life to our neurosis, to our fears, to our, you know, to our suffering, our challenges. And this process of just settling into breathing, being with the breath, kind of begins to shift those priorities so that something can restore, something can re-emerge, something can become whole. So, I hope that made sense. So Monday was relax, Tuesday was recognition, yesterday was respect, today is restore, and tomorrow will be release. That is often more closely related to, you know, identified as part of Buddhist practice. And, but all the first four processes set the stage for kind of a healthy release. And that's the topic for tomorrow. So thank you all very much, and I look forward to meeting tomorrow.
