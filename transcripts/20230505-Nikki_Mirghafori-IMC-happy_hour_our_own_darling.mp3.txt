 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Here we go. Great. Okay. Well, hello again and welcome to happy hour everyone. Wherever in the world you are joining, whatever this time zone might be. So for today's theme, I wanted to invite us to practice with self-kindness, self-appreciation in a way, not in a selfish way, but in a way of we're often looking outside forsaking ourselves for others, perhaps, and sometimes perhaps in romantic relationships, we're looking for the other, for the other to make us happy. Not everyone, but romantic love tends to be idealized quite a bit as the answer to all the suffering and all the issues and problems and sadnesses in our culture and many cultures. So there is a beautiful poem that a friend of mine shared with me yesterday and it took my breath away. It's such a beautiful poem. So I wanted to share the poem with you and yeah, maybe I'll share it at the beginning and then also share it when we're meditating together. So the poem is by a celebrated author and poet whose name is Maggie Smith. And the name of the poem is Bride, Bride, B-R-I-D-E. And you are welcome to either make it gender neutral for yourself or get in touch with your femininity. You know, yin yang, we all have aspects of both feminine masculine in us. So see how it can work for you. But really the idea of the poem is embracing love and care for ourselves. So here we go. How long have I been wed to myself? Calling myself darling, dressing for my own pleasure each morning. Having perfume to turn me on. How long have I been alone in this house but not alone? Married less to the man than to the woman silvering in the mirror. I know the kind of wife I need and I become her. The one who will leave this earth at the same instant I do. I am my own bride, lifting the veil to see my face. Darling, I say, I have waited for you all my life. So with that, let's collect ourselves in meditation. Let's arrive. Let's settle in our posture. Perhaps calling ourselves darling. Darling, here you are darling. Here you are sitting darling. I have waited for you all my life. Here you are. This being, this person who is silvering in the mirror. This beloved silvering in the mirror. Standing, connecting with the breath, the body of this beloved, just as it is in this long SHOW. Letting the breath move freely through the rooms of this house. This dear breath, this friend, this companion throughout our life. This breath is not a stranger. We forsake sometimes this breath. For the thoughts of another past, present, future, can we be here? Beginning with care, appreciation. Receiving this gift. Not taking it for granted. There will be a day that there will be no more. And however the body is and however the body is feeling, receiving this breath tired, haggard, anxious, energetic, heavy, light, however it is. Greeting, greeting this body, this house, this heart. Oh darling, darling. As if we lift the veil to meet ourselves in this moment. And we have metta and we have loving kindness for ourselves, for this dear being who is me. Our own beloved other. Thank you. Haven't youys might be posted on there. This being, this darling who is silvering, who is silvering in the mirror. This will be our last, final Publication. you you you and we be the caring companion to ourselves we seek you you you you you you you you I'll read the poem one more time see what phrases resonate for you how long how long have I been wed to myself how long have I been wed to myself calling myself darling dressing for my own pleasure each morning choosing perfume to turn me on how long have I been alone in this house but not alone married less to the man than to the woman silvering in the mirror silvering with the mirror I know the kind of wife I need and I become her the one who will leave this earth at the same instant I do I am my own bride lifting the veil to see my face darling I say I have waited for you all my life you you you you you you you you you you the one who will leave this earth at the same instant I do lifting the veil to see my face you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you you How long have I been wed to myself? Darling, I say, I have waited for you all my life. And we have that sense for this dear being who is ourselves. And we have mitta, goodwill, love, acceptance, friendliness. Into our lives, into our bodies. With kindness. And as we turn towards the closing of this practice period. And we appreciate that each being, each person around us, people we know, people we don't know, people who are dear to us, people with whom we have challenges, they too are their own dear being. Our lives are precious to them. May they have kindness for themselves. May they meet themselves as a dearly beloved. Just as we wish to meet ourselves as a dearly beloved, caring for ourselves, cherishing like a mother, like a beloved. Justing that as we plant seeds of care, of mitta friendliness for ourselves, for this person who is me, filling our own cup with kindness, with care. We can be more available to fill others' cups, to care for them, not in a needy way so that they take care of us, but with no strings attached, with generosity, with freedom, with kindness. Abundant kindness. So trusting that this act of kindness for ourselves, mitta for ourselves, is a radical act of generosity towards others. May all beings everywhere be happy, be healthy, have ease. May all beings know their own goodness. May they be free, including ourselves. Thanks everyone. Thanks for your practice. So different ways to relate to cultivating kindness, friendliness, appreciation, acceptance for ourselves. Now we have time to turn to community practice and the invitation is, in small groups, to perhaps share if you like, something about this practice or the way we related to it today using this poem through this poem. Is there something that lit up for you? Is there something that connected for you? Or maybe something that was challenging for you? Perfectly fine. Or you can just offer your silence and say pass. Perfectly fine. And you can show up in a breakout group, just with silence, just with care, just say pass, hold space and the next person will offer something, the next person will offer something that's perfectly acceptable. And if you do choose to speak, please just share from your own experience, not asking questions, not directing the conversations, just show up with your own heart, with your own practice and share with others. So I'm going to make the breakout rooms now and we're going to go alphabetical order is the invitation. And again, the prompt is what came up for you? What connected for you? What came up for you? What connected with this practice, with those way of relating to the practice and what did not connect for you perhaps or was challenging either. You can talk about either or and again, speaking from your own experience, not directing. So I've made the rooms and take care of yourselves, take care of each other. Here we go. Welcome back everyone. The rooms are closed, everybody's back and we have time for reflections, questions, comments, practice reports, especially if you haven't spoken in the group for a while, it'd be lovely to hear from you. How was it for you? What did you discover in the group? What did you discover in the practice? And also I'm going to post the link to the poem which showed up in the New Yorker magazine so that everyone can have a link to it. And I'm sure I trust that it'll be sent later by our dear Neil to the Google groups. So Reba, Reba, I see your hand is up. Yes. Hi, it's nice to see you again. I've studied with you on retreat before and I really appreciated your offering the opportunity to change the gender of the poem and I just wanted to offer just a further expansion and awareness that I was adding to my own practice to help myself be more present just to say not the partner in the other room but myself to move it out of the idea of to acknowledge not only the gender issue but also this very particular kind of heteronormative relationship model that doesn't reflect all of our realities and reflect my reality. So it's another place to just help my body and my spirit be more present. Beautiful. Thank you for sharing that. I'm delighted to hear how you worked with it to make it work for you and the creativity. Yeah, it's invited, especially with the practice of meta for us to accept all parts of us, all of us in different ways and a particular poem in a particular way may not work or might even be like, yeah, that's not my reality. So yeah, thank you for doing that. Also, thanks for bringing that into the space. Appreciate it, Reba. You're so welcome. Okay. Let's see, Sarah, I see your hand, please. Hi there, Sangha. I usually can't make happy hour but I listen to the recordings on Audio Dharma frequently. And so I'm delighted to be here tonight. And it's the perfect theme for me as well because my partner is Moroccan and he just went back home for a month. And so I'm here in the US without a partner for a month. It's a great poem to carry through this next month and just the concept of like dating myself. I spend a lot of time with him when he's here and I'm going to have a lot of time on my hands to spend with myself. So I'm just, this felt very serendipitous. Thank you. Thank you, Sarah. Thank you for sharing that. I so appreciate the timeliness of this poem for what's arising for you right now. That's lovely. Great. And there are a few reflections I see in chat. Oh, did I change the chat? Oh, I haven't changed the chat settings. You're also welcome to share your reflections publicly if you wanted to. But let's see, one reflection just to me. So I contemplate a lot about I, me versus soul and body, which I, are we trying to practice today? Great, great. That's a great, that's so interesting. So the question really has to do with the teachings on the relative and the absolute. Actually, some people don't call it the absolute, the ultimate or the universal. So the relative and the universal or ultimate. So the teachings really also in Buddhism that exist about self, there is a self, you exist, you have an address, you have feelings, if you get hurt, you grow, you die. So there is a self. And then there are the teachings about not self, impersonality, it's not personal. It's everything that's happening. The body also, even the body is not personal. It's nature, et cetera, et cetera. So the way I invite relating to the practice of metta, metta doesn't quite work if you're wishing well for these impersonal atoms that are arising and passing away very quickly, or the four elements that are arising and passing away. So metta works better in the relative, with relative concerns in the relative realm. But actually the practice of metta leads to insights in the ultimate. It leads to sense of compassion and care and love that's universal with no strings attached for all beings everywhere. So that's how I invite you to relate to that, the person who shared that question. One more reflection, send, love the poems, PT with tears. It's beautiful. PT meaning joy, join Polly with tears. That's lovely. Thank you so much for sharing that. And yeah. And let's see. This is a long note. Let's see if I can read it quickly. What should I do? I have thoughts that I am a bad person with examples from past keep coming up. I say, I know, and I'm different now and getting better and becoming peaceful. I also send loving kindness to people whom I have heard if they show up in my thoughts that highlight, I am bad. Can you please share your thoughts? Thank you for sharing that question. Yeah. The need for forgiveness, the thoughts that arise with the stories that you are bad and believing those stories and being stuck there. So what I recommend, what they suggest, sometimes it might be helpful to switch to the practice of forgiveness, actually, self forgiveness as much as possible. May I forgive myself as much as possible in this moment? It may not be completely accessible, but tuning into that sense of self forgiveness for yourself or asking for forgiveness in your heart from others and maybe making amends later. But that's the practice that's needed because sometimes the, what, what this question or asked, it can feel like too hard to, to get through that. So the appropriate practice would be self, it would be both forgiveness as well as, here's another thing to turn towards oneself, towards oneself with self compassion for the pain, because in that moment, you're the one who's really hurting. You're taking a dagger of memory and just stabbing yourself with it. You're bad. You're bad. Ouch. You're taking that pain and letting there be compassion for that pain because it's not helping anyone. That, that, that pain, we think that it's leading to remorse, but actually it's getting us stuck. It's forgiveness that leads us to remorse and taking responsibility. So that's a short Darmette there. You are welcome. The person who asked the question, you're very welcome. Another person said, thank you for the poem. Perfect for me. I'm delighted to hear that there are many people who connected with the poem and those who, who chose to, to work with it, to, to make it work for them. So beautiful. So yeah, full, full day of practice. Thank you all. Thank you so much for your cultivation. Thank you for your practice. May we all see our own goodness. May we all befriend ourselves. May we all befriend ourselves and befriend others. May all beings be happy. May all beings be free, including ourselves. Thanks everyone. Be well. See you next week.
