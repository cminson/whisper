Dharmette: Alone with Others  
 
Transcribed and edited from a short talk by Gil

When I was, maybe twenty -one or twenty -two, I lived on 
a small dairy farm  for six months . When the husband 
and wife farmer s went on vacation for a week , they left 
me in charge of the farm and the cows. It was in a rural 
place  at the end of a long road. During that week I didn ’t 
leave , and I talked to no one. One day in the distance , I 
saw a mail carrier  walking  down the hill, but that was the 
only person I saw. It was the first time in my life that I’d 
been alone for so long. It was not intentional  – it wasn ’t 
like I was planning to be alone. I was just left to take 
care of the farm.  
 
During those seven days , as the time pass ed, my 
senses became more acute . I became more aware . I 
would see things, and they  would glisten.  I’d see some 
object , and it was glistening , bright , and stood out in 
highlight. I thought, “This is cool .” I would walk around , 
amazed at how beautiful things were.  
 
I became more acutely aware of my thoughts , in a way 
that I ’d never been before. I guess it was the only 
conversation happening . It wasn ’t like my thoughts were 
of any significance . I was n’t thinking deep or special thoughts. It was more like the miracle of thinking.  
 
I felt this intimacy with the world around me , and  with 
myself. This experience  was impactful for me ; it felt very 
important  – like a wonderful way of being in the world  – 
this kind of intimacy, awareness , and presence. In 
retrospect, just being present was enough. Just being 
here was so rich ! 
 
After these seven days, the two farmers came home . 
They were friends , and it was nice to have them back. 
We continued our life together , but I no ticed that the 
intimacy , the acuteness  of my senses , and the 
wonderful  feeling of being connected to myself on the 
inside faded away. I was involved in conversations , 
concerns , and social things . Things got busier and 
faster , and the intimacy  just receded . When I saw this, I 
knew I had a task, which  was to learn how to be alone 
with others . I didn ’t want to be a hermit  – that was clear.  
 
That I should go live alone some place wasn ’t the 
lesson . But I felt that I had  to honor what had happened 
to me. So the task was, “How can I be alone with 
others ?” That’s the wording I use d. What that meant 
was, “How do I pay attention to what my mind does ? 
How do I live my life so that I don’t get pulled off or 
swept away into : the social world, social concerns, 
wanting people to like me, how I look  – all the ways we 
get caught up in social games , activities,  and things to do. How can I not get caught in that , so that I can 
somehow stay in th at acute sensitivity  – that wonderful  
sense of intimacy and presence  that I had experienced .  
 
In some ways, having that question was part of the 
momentum that got me involved in Buddhist practice . It 
became one of the questions I carried with me for years : 
not to avoid the world , or step away from the world, but 
to be with it with a certain kind of presence , 
peacefulness, or ease, so that there was that intimacy 
and connectedness inside and outside.  
 
I learned a lot about th is during  my years of meditation 
practice. In meditation, I learned about what my mind 
does, what motivates me , and the concerns I get caught 
up in . But equally  important was that by meditating 
regularly , I got a very strong , first-hand , visceral sense 
of what it ’s like to be grounded here, to be centered  
here, to be present . It was a growing sense of being 
here in an embodied way .  
 
Somehow there ’s ballast , stability, stillness that lives 
inside . This grew over time, and became a powerful 
memory . But more often, i t increasingly became a 
presence  – something that was available here. I ’d lose 
touch with it , but it would become easier and easier to 
come back to it . That sense of inner  steadiness , 
stability , or stillness was the place from which I could be 
alone with others without being removed from others.   
Being alone with others didn ’t mean I was separate . It 
allowed for intimacy, because  it had this quality of acute 
sensitivity . Just being here, the  senses were operating 
acutely, as they had been on the farm  – really tak ing in, 
feeling, and experienc ing whatever is happening . With 
others , it meant being with the person I was  with – being 
there for the m.  
 
One of the ways that  being alone with others translates 
for people doing meditation practice is when  you find 
some benefit from meditation . You’re a little calmer, a 
little bit more settled, less agitated, more peaceful, a 
little happier. There are a ll kind of benefits you might 
get. When you ’re meditating, you ’re not involved in the 
world so actively . You’re not caught up in concerns or 
activities . You’re not on the computer . You’re just here . 
So if you’d like, one of the tasks  is to consider , “How 
can you take home some of those benefits, such as the 
calm or settledness ? How can you continue those 
benefits?  How can you have them  in your daily life ?” 
These benefits in meditation can be  a reference point 
for the possibility of continu ing them in your ordinary life .  
 
It’s so easy to get pulled into the world of things , 
activities , and what we ’re doing . But what would it take? 
What can you stay in touch with? Is there something 
available here , which is  growing and developing as you 
meditate ? That benefit becomes more a felt sense that you can tap into and have as  a support . What kind of 
greater self -understanding are you getting about what 
your mind does  and what your concerns are ?  
 
If you have some ca lm, peace, or sense of well -being, 
what cause s you to lose touch with that, to sacrifice it , 
and give it up ? Why do you give it up? What do you give 
it up for?  
 
When you get up from your meditation , notice the 
benefit . It doesn ’t have to be very dramatic  – it can just 
be a teeny bit . But because it ’s a little bit different from 
how you live your normal life, it gives you a reference 
point to ask that question  – to see the difference , and to 
see what you do.  
 
Over time , you’ll learn more and more how to be in that 
good, beneficial place, and you ’ll see how you lose it . 
You’ll start making wiser choices about how to stay 
connected, grounded and present , here – because 
maybe it feels richer , more valuable , or just more 
wonderful .  
 
Maybe “to be alone with others” won’t be your language . 
Perhaps  your language will be : “to be calm with others, 
to be connected with yourself and others, to be at peace 
with others .” You may have your own way of saying it.  
 
What was important for me, in being alone with others, is that it showed me  that the practice is also in the 
world. It isn’t only about stepping away from the world . It 
has to be applied to the world we ’re living in. For me, it  
has been so rich, going back and forth in the interface , 
the oscillation , and the rhythm  of practic ing meditation , 
being alone, and practicing in daily life.  
 
I hope your meditation practice gives you a vantage 
point from which to enter into your normal lif e, and that 
your normal life gives you material for your meditation 
practice.  
 
Thank you.
