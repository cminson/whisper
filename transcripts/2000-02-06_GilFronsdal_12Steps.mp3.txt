 foundation for for living a new way and part of that the life comes from having some appreciation of our good ethics of having a good ethical foundation in our life and it's not particularly moralistic this attitude I'd rather that when we are no longer involved with harming other people no other lying to people or stealing or harming people from the day when we decide to do that that commitment or that decision to do that to whatever degree that commitment is can be a source of delight so sort of appreciation of rejoicing one of the words that Buddhism uses to rejoice in your own good qualities that come from such a decision and from that that arises the possibility of joy and joy is much more connected to medication practice but doesn't have to be but to begin appreciating the small and large joys of our lives so those joys become a foundation they help us cultivate meditation practice help us cultivate concentration so after joy the next kind of precondition or some people called prerequisite some condition for further work of liberation is tranquility the commonest is word passati and most people a lot of people when they think about meditation associated with commonness and tranquility and a lot of people are attracted to meditation practice because it's going to bring them some commonness and some tranquility when I do these about when I teach the introductory course in Palo Alto I usually warn people I say look the point of meditation practice of insight meditation is not to become calm but rather to see clearly and one of the reasons I say this is that there's a tremendous attachment people have two states of calm to becoming tranquil and often the attachment people have to calmness is in direct proportion to the degree to which they're agitated and direct proportions of the degree to which their mind is filled with fire and clinging and tension and their bodies fill with such things and so they're desperate to have some kind of you know relief from that kind of tension of the mind and the body and they've heard you know that's that the mindfulness practice is a great form of stress reduction but if meditation practice is only being done for purposes of physical and mental stress reduction then I don't you're not going to go very far in terms of the spiritual potential that the practice has to offer and that's why I say that it's not enough just simply to focus on calm and relaxation that there has to be some much more deeper seeing into the structures of our identity the structures of our kind of self concepts that we hold on to that we kind of face our personal existence on there has to be some very very deep penetrating insight into the deeper attachments of our life it's possible to be free of worry and free of anxiety free of fear in a kind of conventional way and Pearson might say that on calm today but that person's mind is still operating out of some very deep attachments they're calm and I'm not worried because basically everything's going well that day and you know the Sun is out and they had a nice nap and you know phone call phones have their call rung that off in or whatever it is so if you know we've done something maybe good to help bring some calmness because the commonest is often part of the conditions around us and we don't see that there's still seeds or momentum or the potential in us of being attached to maybe there's still attachments of certain things there can certainly be attachment to common tranquility I read what once I've never seen it again but I saw in some book that in Buddhism it said that the last attachment is the attachment to tranquility so if you really want to be free the last thing you need to let go of is your attachment to tranquility I think you need to let go before the latin hopefully before that the Buddha talks about tranquility of the body and tranquility of the mind as being somewhat two different things there's a couple of stories about tranquility or calmness one is a famous one of the famous Buddhist king Ashoka Ashoka was the great Buddhist king of India he's kind of held up as a paradigm of the wise Buddhist king where he ruled ancient India he lived around somewhere between the year 2 and 300 BC but before he became a great Buddhist king he was an awful king and he went around India he was he was the first person to kind of united in India and he united his with the sword went around conquering the new neighboring countries within India the content of India and he was fairly quite vicious and was great great battles and great carnage in the battlefield and it said that one day after defeating an enemy in a vicious battle where there were many many many people killed in the battlefield he walked across the battlefield across all the carnage and the dead bodies the weapons lines everywhere maybe still body-screened people started quite died he was still screaming and moaning and I he was felt quite distressed by this it had a big impact on him the power of what he saw and the middle of him surveying all this I at Buddhist monk began walking across the field from one end today I was like the path that he was he was on happened to be through that field and he walked through all that carnage with a demeanor of calmness and tranquility the king had never seen anyone before and it was a contract and so greatly for his own agitation is a agitation of maybe remorse but all the death maybe a vegetation of seeing all the death perhaps the education of all his ambition and his drive which had brought him to that point when you're a great conqueror like that you probably lived in certain degree of fear the education of this fear and in contrast to his education there was this a very very soothing calm monk that was walking across the field and that caught his attention and he went over and talked to the monk and the monk said this I can think I have with me attention is the path to the deathless inattentiveness is the path to death the attentive dying not the inattentive are already dead so attention is pretty important so that again coffee Kings attention and he thereby became a Dharma King he renounced the war and violence and became an advocate of non-violence he abolished capital punishment in his kingdom he abolished he set up a whole country of animals human people hospitals all over and became known as this great righteous king of ancient India but the impact that really changed him was the impact of meeting someone who's common serene it said the similar story existed for the Buddha he was quite agitated when he finally left the palace and encountered the real conditions of the world and then he also saw a not a Buddhist monk but a pronunciation he was also quite calm and he got his attention and I think in my own life also I've met people in my early years of practice who there were certain tranquility and calmness to who they were that showed me there was possible to be live in a different way than I was all living at the time and I was greatly inspired by the example of these people the other story is another one of these are rated for the stories the last one is already roll the carnage and this is a then story buddy Dharma was the great Zen monk who brought the Zen from India to China and he was quite an austere teacher apparently and he sat in a cave by himself for a long time meditating in China and the person who was going to become his successor was a monk Buddhist monk who was quite agitated and felt he had much success in his years of practice it was quite had a lot of it didn't have any peace of mind and he heard there was a Zen master up in the mountain in this cave that you could help him maybe so he made his way up in the middle of winter and stood in the snow outside the cave and buddy Dharma would have nothing to do with him and this is the you know maybe the hopefully mythical already version of the story after some day the standing in the snow waker which is cut off his right or one of his arms and then presented the boy Dharma as proof of his sincere sincerity that he really wanted help he really wanted to be sincere about practicing and well that got great armless attention so I think the story of him cutting off his arms partly told to indicate the strength of the need is that the this man was really at odds with himself really didn't have any peace he was desperate for some some different way of living and he was so motivated that he would go to great extremes I hope none of us go to those extremes but I think sometimes it takes go extending oneself further than our comfortable lives if one really wants to discover the full possibility of freedom so finally buddy Dharma said well what do you want and the guy said my mind is really agitated I want peace of mind and buddy Dharma said to him show me your mind where is your mind that's so agitated show to me and waker at that moment was awakened and the way the stories often understood is that in being asked to look for the very mind which is agitated which is on fire look at the very mind which is suffering in that turning the mirror back on the mind itself he found the mind was not there or was empty or the mind was already tranquil or if the mind was transparent or the mind had a quality of freedom already many of us are agitated because of the way we relate to the objects of the world the obvious of what what the mind can know we're so preoccupied with what we know and what we know for example is we know about our relationships and we're agitated about relationships we know about work we know about our bodies we know about our security we know all these things that fill the mind with knowing but the mind itself which is a container for that knowing if you look for it strange things begin happening you look deeply for it and this is what happened to wake up he was liberated when he looked for his own mind when he kept looking looking for that at his problems maybe there was no ends of problems but if you looked somehow had the ability to look back into the mind into the depths of the mind then something very different happens so I don't know how you how that story sits with you but the how do we become how do we develop tranquility or commonness or peace one form of calmness which would never be underestimated is the calmness that comes from living an ethical life I have done unethical things in my life and the consequence of that I've gotten really agitated boy oh boy I couldn't believe it and the adaptation afterwards was simply not worth the fleeting pleasure that it seems to provided in those circumstances but some calmness not simply not having anything that bad in the background but some tranquility some ease of mind knowing that one is blameless the idea being blameless is a very important teaching in Buddhism and the Buddha said that if you're blameless means you can go into any room and you know that you're blameless you know that no one has any any cause to criticize you so the idea of being blameless at least from this moment being blameless I'll tell you you'll hear another story following that story and you probably know many of you the story of Angouli Mala who another one of these are in this one's x-rated xr rated stories they're nice at the R-rated because they make them some ways very real he was the mass murderer in the time of the Buddha and he had killed 999 people in his quest to kill a thousand and each person killed he had a he had it at one of the fingers to his necklace he had his big necklace of the 999 fingers and he one more person and it turned out an easy victim was his mother now the Buddha heard of kind of in his psychic powers that Angouli Mala was about to kill his mother which is really bad karma so and so the Buddha said I'm gonna go into the forest and take care of the situation some goodly mala saw this Buddhist monk just walking in his forest unarmed unattended all by himself oh great this is an easy easy easy victim these boys talk about easy I just need a thousand people here just presenting himself so he started going after the Buddha and the Buddha just stayed calm and continued to calmly walk down the road and Angouli Mala couldn't catch up to him and the faster he ran the calmer the Buddha walked and the greater distance there was just you know Buddha's using the psychic powers and magic and so you just couldn't catch up to Angouli Mala just couldn't catch up to the Buddha so finally in frustration then murderer said hey you stop and the Buddha continued calmly and he turned over turned over looked over shoulder and said I've already stopped why don't you stop now that caught Angouli Mala's attention and he understood he was dealing with someone who had something else in mind and and he understood that in what the Buddha was saying was I've already stopped my agitated mind I've stopped you know I've found peace in my own mind why don't you stop also stop your agitated activity in search for revenge and whatever he was doing with his mass murdering and so that Angouli Mala then became the disciple of the Buddha and he became a Buddhist monk and became fully awakened it became more of a fully fully enlightened beings then the story continues where one day the Buddha and Angouli Mala were walking through a village and it might have been a village where Angouli Mala had killed some of the victims anyway in any case they were walking through this village and there was a woman going through labor things and it was very difficult labor for her and she was I guess making painful noises all the yelling and screaming they had no very little help back then right in ancient India so there was a there's a belief in ancient India that a statement which is true if stated almost as a kind of like a it's called a true statement this has certain magic powers and if you say something which is really true that that somehow has an effect on the people around you and will produce beneficial results so the Buddha told Angouli Mala oh you should make a true statement to help this woman through her delivery go and tell her that I have never harmed anyone my whole life and Angouli Mala looked at the Buddha and said what I can't say that you know I'm one of the most awful people around what I did in my time and then the Buddha said okay well don't say that the day that I was ordained as a Buddhist monk I have never harmed anyone yeah I can say that that was a true statement so he went there into the house of the woman and said since the day I was ordained I have never harmed anyone and then the baby was born maybe you know to meet someone who could be really honest like that or was enough to relax who knows but the point being that he became blameless from the day he became ordained as a Buddhist monk and there was certain power of that blamelessness that the mythic story translates into helping someone through labor so a little bit unsettling story for some of us the idea of someone could get away with 999 murders and then just become Buddhist monk and get enlightened and that's it there's quite a bit more to the story than that but that's been other time so there's the tranquility that can come from being blameless there's a tranquility that comes from being concentrated and this is what a lot of people associate meditation with if you focus on your breathing for most people if you kind of can can rest your attention on your breath keep coming back to something very simple and mundane as you're breathing then the normal ways in which the mind is agitated kind of monkey mind is chasing many different concerns and preoccupations and fears or whatever it begins to quiet down the mind can't do too many things so if you have the mind finally resting in one thing kind of thing to stay here you know stay put then begins to quiet down that cornfield likes to like in this likes to liken this to training a puppy probably heard him talk about that the puppy keeps running away and you don't scream and yell and beat your puppy you're kind of very kindly saying come back here come back here and slowly the puppy begins to calm down slowly I guess learns to sit and you can totally train or whatever the analogy is so concentration is very important for for tranquility but more important for us who do mindfulness practice is the ability for us to see directly our agitated mind or at least our agitation one of the very important principles of mindfulness is that we don't chase after the ideal way of being as much as we try to understand pursue what keeps us from the ideal if we want to be loving we don't try to make ourselves loving we try to understand what get what stands in the way of our loving if you try it want to be compassionate this is what stands in the way of me compassionate if we want to be fearless understand your fear really well if you want to have confidence understand your fear really well your your doubts and if you want to be calm understand your agitation really well understand the forces of agitation within you understand what it is it triggers you to start worrying or being afraid or whatever and then in seeing that clearly knowing it see if you can discover a new relationship to it how can you relate to that agitation so you're not continuing to feed it and fuel it but rather so that maybe you give it lots of space and acceptance so it can begin to unwind by itself the tremendous power of open awareness simply open awareness generous awareness compassion awareness of what's actually here begins to unravel some of the very things that stand in the way of the ideal so to see very clearly into the nature of what actually makes us tick is a very very important part of mindfulness practice it's not something which people would rather many people would rather that the spiritual practice didn't involve that because it's not very spiritual as it's kind of look at your fear or your agitation or your ambition or your hatred or your your lust or your aversions or your confusion so whatever it is that's kind of perpetuating your agitation you'd rather say well I do this great meditation on infinite love that's all I do some great invitation and meditation on infinite light that's really you know spiritual but this stuff of looking at my fear I mean what's that but this is the way it works in Buddhism that to really be honest and see directly is very helpful there's of course a wonderful interplay between the calm that we develop in concentration and and our ability to see honestly what's going on in our minds the more calm we are the easier it is to see clearly and then the easier you to see clearly the common we can that we get one of the great analogies of developing calmness is that of this the pond the agitated pond and you probably all know this you know here is not how you talk about enough times but the analogy is that if the pond you have a muddy pond if you take a sick into a muddy pond and stir it up it'll never settle become clear but if you leave the pond alone don't stir it up with time all the mud and silt in the pond will settle into the bottom and you'll have a crystal clear pond the teaching here is that there's something very powerful to be said about seeing clearly what's going on within us and not agitating it not stirring it up anymore not judging it or criticizing it or fixing trying to fix it but simply to hold it in open awareness hold it and open awareness hold it and open to it hold it let it hook you held there and then so many things in our life by themselves will begin to settle not only that but the very holding itself is a movement of tranquility of calmness we meet our agitation with some modicum of calmness come seeing allowing it to be there and that calmness and begins to let the pond the pond of the mind settle tranquility is never an end in itself for Buddhist practice but rather is a stepping stone so that we can see ever more deeply it's very hard to see people clearly if we're agitating one of the wonderful things are examples of this is when the mind is tranquil and calm the most mundane things in life can seem spectacular can seem to be awesome miraculous the mysterious when the mind is tranquil you can leave the meditation session or leave wherever you're on go outside and you can look at a leaf from a tree and be blown away Wow when you're agitated probably won't even notice there's any trees out there you can walk out here and you can you can notice the most simple Monday thing in the world somewhat you know discarded candy wrapper on the pavement outside and you can read from it with it with enough calm and tranquility peace of mind that candy wrapper on the pavement can be one of the most beautiful things the world has ever created isn't that amazing have you ever had that experience that way I hope so some of you I mean otherwise you think I'm crazy you know those of you that haven't had that experience thinking I'm talking about something crazy hearing you know what why bother with a candy wrapper I don't know why you bother the candy wrappers just you go out and just kind of blows you away Wow so there's something that happens very special about when the mind is tranquil that allows it appreciate the details of our present moment life what's going on in the present moment if we're agitated the chances are vegetation is about something in the past and something in the future and so it's very hard to appreciate what's going on in the present moment but in order to develop a deeper insight to practice we need to have the kind of interest in the present moment where even a candy wrapper on the pavement blows you away is fascinating because you have to be able to meet the details of your own mind of your own heart your own feelings your emotions your thoughts your reactions your fears yes and meet them with the same kind of be willing and interested in meet them in the present moment as they occur in the present moment if you will be interested in your each inhalation each exhalation as if it's one of the most amazing things in the world enough so that you'll be willing interested to stay present in the present moment if you're not interested if you don't have if you're not interested in the present moment it's going to be all too easy for you to flip off into thinking about the past and thinking about the future but the work of liberation requires us to stay in the present moment because the present moment is a stepping stone to being free not to say that thinking about the past and thinking about the future should never be done but for the deeper work of liberation you have to sit to stabilize yourself in the present moment you have to be willing to stay in the present there's no freedom without being in the present freedom has to do about something occurs in the present moment as some people will sometimes say they will describe freedom as being experience of timelessness and timelessness only exists in the present the timeless presence so from our joy joy is a condition for equisit for the possibility of tranquility and calm and one of the ways that works is that when our joy especially in meditation practice when our joy has lived itself out when the energy of joy in its own natural way has dissipated what gets left is experience of tranquility and many people will find that tranquility that follows joy meditative joy is so much more sublime so much more pleasurable so much more delightful than joyous or bliss rapture and it can very hard to people who are have never really had a lot of intense meditative joy when the first occurs they think they're enlightened this is like the best Wow and then they get stronger and this is even better and then at some point you realize that it calms itself or relaxes and you enter into this next stage of tranquility and calmness Wow I don't think I want that kind of joy anymore I know something better now but then you can get very agitated about that and which I did for example on one long retreat I sat where I knew I had the experience that there was many better than deep joy that's a very intense joy meditative joy so I could feel one point from my meditation that's your way beginning to rise because it kind of naturally fall comes right and you meditate a certain point joy will often just come by its own so I started feeling it coming on and I also oh I can't have this I know something better than this a deep estate of concentration so I'll resist it you know I'll hold it back and I remember doing walking meditation back and forth and back and forth saying I'm not gonna feel actually no way and I just got a headache and finally I just let go of my resistance to joy and enjoy welled up inside of me because I'm no longer holding it at a distance and and lumbar hold it once I kind of I spent even maybe half an hour resisting it and once I kind of opened to it allowed it to come it came a peak and it passed within a minute or so and then I found myself in that deeper place of tranquility so I created all this education because I had this attachment to tranquility and aversion to that make something which I thought was whole course sir so tranquility calmness serenity one of the traps of all this is to try to hold yourself in a stage of being calm to try to force yourself to be calm when you're not or if you have some lot of come of calm or any kind of calm and then try to not maneuver carefully kind of get through life you know you know without trying to hold on to it for all dear life better than work either part of the the experience part of the flexibility of practice that the possibilities required of us as we practice is a willingness to allow our mind and heart to flow as the conditions and within us and around us change and if we're getting more agitated then allow that to happen without trying to hold on in the form of attachment to resistance to it happening but rather use your mindfulness to follow along and be present for what's happening let the mindfulness lead but let the mindfulness kind of hold everything don't try to resist or to stay attached to any particular states of mind however it is useful to appreciate tranquility and calmness and to do maybe simple things in your daily life that can help foster it you know avoid doing things in an agitated way if you can't do too many things at once doing one thing one thing at a time is one of the great spiritual practices unfortunately those of us who want to get more done and you know give yourself sacred time the the old tradition current current tradition some places of the Sabbath is it was a period of sacred time where people allowed themselves to pause and experience something different the sacred pause the sacred presence that's very different from the normal agitated active life but appreciate calmness one of the last thing I'll say now one of the themes in Buddhism is that your awareness and appreciation of wholesome states of mind a beautiful states of mind strengthens them and your awareness of unwholesome states of mind weakens the unwholesome states of mind it's a beautiful thing all you have to do is so I have to do is continue to be mindful of whatever is happening and the mindfulness itself just by being mindful and matter-of-fact away will naturally weaken the unhealthy states of mind that arise and will strengthen the healthy ones so appreciate your tranquility and calmness foster it to some degree but in no way be attached to it no way hold on to it let it come and go so that's my talk on tranquility do you guys have any questions or comments you'd like to make you had a couple of minutes yes oh that yeah grit your teeth I don't know if I remember them so well because I don't practice so much in that list but the list something like I think about something else the good truth to teeth means like say it keeps really saying no to it sometimes it's very wise when we have an obsessive thought patterns is keep going over and over and over again he's trying to be mindful now of it and just keeps coming back sometimes you just need to say just no to it and nothing to that and so in my false maybe we get the impression that the practice is only about being aware of what's goes on you're never supposed to say no to anything but occasionally when things are just so obsessive like a little child sometimes you have to say no no stop that you mind and then it'll quiet down substitution I'm sorry I don't remember yes I took ibuprofen this morning because my back went out this morning and and so I took the ibuprofen because it's I thought maybe would produce any information that might be starting up and make it a bit easier for me so that was my criteria this morning and and I wondered about it sitting here because I'm a little bit of pain because my back and you know this was a wise I wise me to keep sitting here and then I thought well you know especially when I was sitting here I was feeling the silence I was wondering well and once I start talking I might not pay attention to my back so much anymore and I might maybe you know you know maybe if there's a 45 minute talk I just will make it worse and so there's a big question you know I had to watch very carefully you know what's how am I gonna sit here with my my back pain and and you know what is it wise me to I could show I'm going at a chair and sit in the chair as it was me sit here this way and it would appear my first account I actually wasn't sure and but I had a lot of experience in the past of sitting with back pain where sitting is one of the best things I can do for it for me my particular kind of back pain that I've had so that gave me some confidence and I said I'm not quite sure what to do let me at least you know I'm not damaging anymore at least but let's let's see what happens let's try sitting with it and being careful with my posture and sitting with a pain being present for the pain is it there and see how it goes and once in the course of the sitting I made it I kind of at least once in the middle I kind of made a little correction my posture because it didn't feel like it was working so well my pain my back look at me was gonna hurt it more and that seemed to help again so you know but it took me to really investigating really carefully I basically no half-hour just riding that pain my back and I felt like I needed to ride it I can really be present for it because if I wasn't then I could have hurt myself more I think that if I hadn't been able to stay really present for the pain I wouldn't have been good to have sat this way I would have should have gotten up and got in the chair gone home and write down or something so I don't know if this little personal example answers your question but sit with we sit with pain when we think that it's not gonna damage us and if you think it's gonna be damaging then by all means make some adjustments or change but if it's not gonna damage you it's more it's a great way of developing concentration and insight a lot of understanding can arise out of sitting the pain it's a growing of great teachers if you find that your pain is is agitating you and so the mind gets more and more increasingly agitated because of it then perhaps it's the hands you want to do something different because increasing agitation is not helpful either but it's really you know it's powerful very powerful and useful to sit with pain there's a thing if enough people are requested at some point in Sunday I'm quite happy to give a talk just on pain yeah whole day of pain I gave it I gave a talk on pain just a few years ago and some people make it in a tape library you can check it out from Allison but I'm happy they give one point when I finish the series okay talk about pain someday next couple of months men's team we're combat for the future that the tax of story Well we don't put up in the tradition. We borrow the story from. Well if we take it as pure myth then we can interpret it kind of horizontally psychologically. That if you're really serious about your spirituality it really requires a lot of you. And you really have to be willing to sacrifice a lot or really put a lot of yourself into the fire or give up a lot in order to do it. So cutting off your arms symbolically means you have to really be willing to give up a lot in order to be free. Actually in Zen tradition sometimes you say you have to be willing to die, give up your life. And it's not just for your arm. And the Zen teachers in Japan would yell and during sashine in his endo they would yell you know sit until you die, just die. So you know psychologically the kind of you know that's one way of seeing it but the process is. And otherwise why do they have you know maybe it's kind of a macho tradition. So maybe that's part of it and they go around with swords and whack each other on the shoulders in the old way. Well it's complicated. I mean certainly there's elements truth that there is a thread in Zen of machoism. And it can be you know depending on the individual carrying the sword. Statism. I've heard horrible stories of people you know. There's a sword is used to keep people awake in the Zen monastery. And they come and they say when people are sleeping in meditation you come stand behind them with a big wooden sword and you just kind of whack their shoulders. And if you're skilled knowing what you're doing it doesn't hurt. It's actually quite invigorating. When I was in Zen Macho I used to ask for it to happen. Many people did. I mean I was unusual and really appreciated it. But if someone is not skilled and if it's a really heavy wooden sword it can be quite. I've heard stories in Japan never in America. So in Japan people being damaged from being struck. But that's whenever they talk about those examples they're talking about some particular monk who was really a sadist. And just you use that as a it was something inherent in Zen that requires of it just that they were holding a sword. So great. You know just get my stuff out. I don't know if I'm being very useful in my response to your answer. The part of Zen training is in practice and Zen kind of way of being in the world is to be very energetic totally engaged in what you do. And kind of throw yourself into something and lose yourself in the activity itself. Don't hesitate to think about what you're doing before you do it. Just do it. And the idea of thinking about something is in Zen something that gets in your way of the actual doing. So it tends to be in Zen and its strong emphasis on this vigorous spontaneity. I take the story of the ancient stories in China as being mostly myth. The story of him cutting off his eyebrow and take his pure myth. And the myth continues of course. And that boy was the one who brought the tea plants from India to China. And when he threw down his eye or I don't know if he's brought it but anyways myth is that when he threw down his eyebrow he violates onto the ground. The first he plants sprouted from them. And it's wonderful because the Zen monks used to like to drink this black tea to keep him awake. So Buried Arma gave up his eyelids to stay awake so that we could say with drinking caffeinated tea. Also in Zen tradition you have examples of Zen teachers using a very vigorous action to push the student over the edge into freedom. That a teacher who is really sharp can see when a well practiced student is right on the edge. When there's very little attachments left. They're really concentrated, really present, really kind of coursing along really deeply in their practice. And all they need is a little push to let go of the last thing they have to let go of. To really fall into freedom. And so sometimes that push can be just slamming the door on the student just to think the hard bang. Or sometimes the teacher will come and yell. There's examples of teachers who will see some particular students in the meditation hall as really being right. And they'll come stand behind the teacher and just give out this huge yell. And rather than frightening the student they just let go of the last thing they're holding onto and they just break out into uproarious laughter. Suddenly, what a joke it's all about. So that kind of, because in the Zen tradition that kind of technique of a teacher using some really sharp action to push a student over. Perhaps also lends to the sense that tradition has this kind of a little bit of a violent side to it. The Zen tradition association with the samurai culture of Japan. Which it did have some association with it. It lends it to itself also. The Zen traditions association with not just Zen but all of Japanese Buddhism. Association with World War II and the military government. Most Japanese Buddhist religious groups actively supported with great doctrinal essays the Japanese war effort. So there is this element in Zen that you're pointing to. And American Zen Buddhists have had to contend with this legacy and this kind of momentum of that. And I think you see the, I don't know if you see it well enough but I see it because I've been at the Census Cusen Center for so many years. I've seen over the last 25 years. I call it maturing. I'm mellowing of all that. The rejection of a lot of that. In the Census Cusen Center now, I believe they no longer use this stick, the sword at all. For a while they stopped using it. They only used it if you requested it. And so no one was struck. When I first got there you were just struck. You didn't know when you were in these struck. You were sitting there and they came over and bang. That's interesting. But then they stopped doing it. They only did it in a request. And then after a while they only did it now they stopped doing it entirely. And there's a lot of the kind of more things that kind of felt more and more aggressive that came with the importation of Japanese Zen. I think it's a maturation and a wisdom. And you're finding a much friendlier environment, warmer and more compassionate environment than you did 25 years ago. I think they all continue. The Zen Center in the Census Cusen Center now chants the metasuta, which is not the Zen tradition at all. It's from our tradition. But they're loving, not a chant. It's a Buddhist course on loving kindness. No, no, that's the refuges, which is also a poly from this tradition. But yeah, but don't they chant the metasuta? This is what is done by a person who's skilled and wise. It goes on like that. May all beings be happy. May all beings be free. Just as a mother with her only child. Just as a mother protects her only child. So consider all beings the loving kindness. Something like that. So Zen is a great tradition. I don't want to knock it here. But the difficult there is this legacy that you're pointing to, which people have to grapple with. And you might ask your Zen teachers up there the same question. So we should probably stop so that you don't have to rush and get somewhere next. Thank you all. And I'll see you in two weeks. Thank you.
