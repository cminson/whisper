Good morning. 
It's nice to be back with the Sunday morning online community. 
I hope you can hear me do say something in the chat if the audio is still low. 
Excuse me. 
It's nice to hear that IMC is opening up again for in-person events and for those of you who are local. 
I was. 
. 
. 
okay, good. 
Sounds like the audio is a little bit better. 
One of the. 
. 
. 
you know, I mean there's so many things that have changed since the pandemic started and of course the human loss has been, you know, the most important thing. 
But one of the aspects of our community in meditation practice that I've missed is just sitting in silence with other people. 
You know, and I think there's something very powerful about being in a room together, but not. 
. 
. 
you know, it's unusual that you are just with others, but also in the kind of intimacy and solitude of one's own experience. 
But if there's something there's a powerful field that can be created when we sit in silence and stillness with other people, and I think it helps us to. 
. 
. 
sometimes it can help us to go beyond what we might be capable of doing when we're by ourselves. 
You know, I know for myself I'm sitting and the phone makes a noise where someone says something or the doorbell rings. 
You know, it's very. 
. 
. 
it's very tempting to, you know, just go with that. 
But in a space when everyone is together, and you know, 20, 30, 40, 50, sometimes at ghost talks, I think there's 100, 200 people, maybe 150. 
So it's powerful. 
It's powerful, and I think it's going to take a while before we get up to those kinds of capacities again because of COVID. 
But the other. 
. 
. 
the other aspect of in-person practice that I was just thinking about was the way my Zen teacher, who was mentioned in the bio, Sojin. 
. 
. 
Sojin Mel Weitzman, he passed away about a year ago. 
But he had this custom at the end of a sitting. 
This is at the Berkeley Zendo, Berkeley Zen Center. 
At the end of a sitting, the bells would ring, ding, ding, ding, three bells, and would make the bells. 
And then Mel would get up, and I think make some bells to the altar, and then he would walk over silently to the door, to the door that people would enter and exit. 
And then everyone would file out silently, but as you got to the doorway, you would be faced with Mel, who was just standing there at the door. 
And the custom was that you would bow to each other. 
So a student and teacher would meet and look at each other and bow together. 
You know, and it's a little thing, but it was such a beautiful practice. 
And the years that I was going to sit early in the morning during the week at the Berkeley Zen Center, this was probably more than 15 years ago, that was a highlight for me. 
I don't remember much of the sittings. 
I don't remember much of what else went on. 
But that moment of this connection and this meeting, it was so special and felt so just like this wonderful point that kind of tied everything together, and to just kind of connect and be seen. 
And so I think for me, that kind of interaction with others is a big part of the practice. 
And you know, we're making do with what we have now and the situation that we're in, and very grateful for this capacity to connect online. 
But I will be very happy when we can be together again in that kind of meeting. 
So, Mel, this Zen teacher who was the abbot of the Berkeley Zen Center and San Francisco Zen Center for many years, has been on my mind. 
I just came back from Japan, which is more of a family trip, and we were very fortunate to be able to be there for about five weeks. 
And one of the places we visited was Rinsoen Temple, which is the home temple of Suzuki Roshi, who was the founder of San Francisco Zen Center. 
And San Francisco Zen Center was also a big part of Gil's life and Gil's practice, and Gil's teacher was also Mel, Mel Weitzman. 
So, visiting Rinsoen, one of the things we did with Hoitsu Suzuki Roshi, who is the son of Shunru Suzuki, is we did some chatting for Mel and kind of a little memorial service, and it was very sweet. 
And yeah, in thinking about how Mel's teachings have influenced me and how I practice meditation and vipassana meditation, this word came up, which was a word that another friend has used to describe Mel. 
And the word is imperturbability. 
It's a little bit of a kind of clunky word, I guess. 
It's a beautiful word, but imperturbability. 
What does it mean to be imperturbable? And I think there was a way that Mel, who kind of modeled this, not so much through words, but through his presence, his energy, his actions. 
And I think that there is a quality of being imperturbable that is a very beautiful aspect of this practice. 
There's a line in a very well-known Chinese Buddhist teaching called, it's a long poem called the Shinchin Ming, which is usually translated as trust in mind. 
And you may be familiar, the poem opens with the line, the great way is not difficult for one who has no preferences. 
The great way is not difficult for one who has no preferences. 
What's sometimes translated as the great way is not difficult if you just don't pick and choose. 
And so what does this mean to not have preferences or to let go of picking and choosing, or to let go of preferences? For me, there's some way that I connect this to Mel's imperturbability. 
But it's not, it's not what maybe what we might think at first. 
I mean, so the great way is not difficult for one who has no preferences. 
We could, we could receive that teaching and think, well, as long as I have preferences, this way is going to be very difficult. 
And the way to practice is to get to a place where I don't have any preferences. 
And I think there's some element of truth in that, because the more we sit and the more we become mindful and aware and connected to ourselves and to others, you know, we can just start to see how our own attachment, my attachment to what I want and what I don't want, what I like and what I don't like, can create suffering. 
And there's an element of traditional Buddhist training, certainly monastic training, that is inviting us, or maybe we could say compelling us, to let go of our preferences. 
You know, when you're served food in a Buddhist monastery, you know, it's not like someone comes with a menu and says, okay, what would you like today? And do you want to scramble the eggs with, do you want the eggs with salmon or, you know, mushrooms? You know, it's like, boom, you get your meal and it's plopped down in front of you, right? And that's the practice. 
The practice is to take what's given, to receive what's given. 
And, you know, in a monastery, there is a schedule, you know, a daily schedule of meditations and study and work and rest and bath time and everything is on the schedule. 
So it's not like, oh, you know, what, what shall I do today? What do I feel like? You know, it's like, you just bell rings, you do this, the bell rings, you do that. 
And you wear the same thing, the same kind of robe, then your hair is the same and it's buzzed very short or shaved. 
And so there's a whole lifestyle that is helping us to let go of our preferences and just enter the moment and just take what's given, receive what's given. 
So it's a beautiful training, it's a great training, it's a place where we can see, you know, in the the times that I've been in that system, I've done that training, you know, I could really see these places of resistance. 
I didn't want to wake up at whatever, 3. 
45 am  I didn't want to do this, I didn't want to do that. 
But you just do it, you just do it. 
And in just doing it, something gets softened in us. 
And there's this element of freedom where we're not so controlled, we're not so tight around our preferences. 
So it's a beautiful practice. 
But then I think that maybe there's a little bit of a, I don't know if it's a deeper meaning or another meaning of this to be, to be one who is without preferences. 
And maybe this gets illuminated if we change the word preferences to thinking. 
So if we could say the great way is not difficult for one who has no thoughts or one who has no thinking. 
When you say, okay, you know, maybe, maybe there are, there are ways in meditation to access a place in us, you know, or place in the universe that's so still, that's so silent, that no thoughts arise, right? You know, there's no interpretation, there's no, there's just the kind of the purity of this moment, this experience without being kind of drawn into discursive thinking. 
That can be beautiful. 
And certainly that there can be a lot of beauty and wisdom and learning in those kinds of states. 
However, those are temporary, right? Those are something that may, may arise, but I don't think anyone is living or would necessarily want to live in a way that we didn't learn able to think. 
We didn't have any thoughts. 
And so it's not so much about emptying the mind of thoughts. 
And maybe it's not so much about living a human life and being a human being who doesn't have any preferences, but it's more about our relationship to those thoughts and our relationship to our preferences. 
And so the idea is that what is, what is it like, what does it mean for our thinking to not be a barrier, to not be a problem? And I think there's a way of, of meditating. 
Maybe there's a way of knowing ourselves, of meeting ourselves, and there's a way of being alive, of being a person. 
That we, to have a healthy relationship to our thoughts. 
That we, we use thinking, we appreciate thinking, we, we need thinking, but we're not, we're not a prisoner of our thinking. 
We don't automatically think every, believe every thought that we have is true. 
We don't blindly follow every thought. 
We, we've seen into the nature of thoughts. 
You know, thoughts are so ephemeral, so empty. 
We can think anything, right? You know, if you've been meditating for a little while, you realize you're gonna have some weird thoughts. 
Doesn't mean they're true, right? You know, and so maybe there's a way that we come into a relationship with our preferences. 
That we, we're accepting, you know, we're never gonna fully be done with preferences. 
It's kind of part of being a human being, but that our preferences are not a barrier anymore. 
That there's this kind of full acceptance of who we are, of our humanity. 
That we understand ourselves maybe in a way so thoroughly that we understand how, how preferences function. 
And these two are, are empty. 
These two are impermanent. 
These two are not better or worse than anything else. 
And so to really be living a life of one who has no preferences or one who doesn't pick and choose, maybe is not so much about everything is the same to me. 
I like or everything equally. 
I don't have an opinion what I eat or how I feel or pleasure and pain is exactly the same to me. 
No, that's not, that's not it. 
But it's more like I'm willing to take this moment, this practice, this life as a whole thing, as a whole package. 
I'm not dividing life up into this is good and this is, this is a problem. 
And I think about this because one of the ways that many people who knew Mel, his then teacher, described Mel is that Mel didn't see problems. 
You know, he didn't approach whether it was a community situation or life or another person is that you have all these problems or I have all these problems. 
It was just relating to what was in front of him. 
It was going to just deal with what was in front of him. 
Oh, this is such a big problem. 
I don't know what to do. 
And you know, a problem is when we don't like it and we don't want it and we're splitting it off and it shouldn't be happening, right? And so even when Mel was sick and had cancer, he would just deal with the situation in front of him and the next thing. 
And over time his, you know, as he, as he got more sick and the cancer may be spread or his functioning declined, he wasn't looking. 
You're like, oh, and then this is happening. 
This is going to happen. 
And this is so bad. 
He was just like, okay, this is, this is what I have to do is get from here to there. 
And how am I going to move? And how are we going to do this? And, and so it was really inspiring in a way that to just, to just deal with this moment and not label it as a problem. 
You know, it was just the just request of this moment. 
And when we meditate, we can either sit in a way that we have a lot of problems. 
Oh God, I think monkey mind and I'm thinking so much and I'm fantasizing or I'm thinking of the past and this hurts and that hurts. 
Or it's like, it's just what's happening. 
And we can just accept what's happening and find how, how can I relate to this? How can I be with this? So it's like this dance. 
Every moment is this dance. 
And we're, we're relating, we're adjusting, we're interacting. 
And so, you know, so that's another meaning, maybe, of to be one who has no preferences. 
It doesn't mean that we don't have any preferences, but it means that our preferences are, are not a problem, that we're not captive to our preferences. 
And maybe, maybe that can manifest, it's sometimes as a kind of imperturbability, just this solidity, that we have the confidence and we have a trust that we can meet whatever, whatever this moment brings. 
We may not like it, we may not enjoy it, but we can meet it just the way Mel was meeting each person as they filed out of the meditation hall at just this wonderful eye contact and bow. 
And it was always different, you know. 
It's always different. 
Each person is totally different, has their own energy. 
Each moment is different. 
Don't get locked into thinking that we're the same. 
It's gonna be the same. 
I mean, you know, the problems are all the same. 
It's all, it's new. 
It's always different. 
And that was one of the great aspects of Mel was, was this sense of just this wide acceptance of whoever was in front of him. 
And I've tried to learn from that and emulate that. 
I wanted to end by sharing this poem that I came across last night, which is one of Mel's, I think, I think, longtime students or, or Dharma, Dharma friends. 
Her name is Basya Petnik. 
And the poem is called Ordinary Mel is the Way. 
You've probably, you may have heard this, this teaching, this Buddhist teaching, Zen teaching, which is Ordinary Mind is the Way. 
And it's a wonderful teaching that basically is pointing us back to this ordinary moment. 
You know, often we're looking for something special. 
We're looking for some special state that's going to solve our problems, right? Or it's like anything but this state. 
It's got to be something better than this. 
And so Ordinary Mind is saying everything we need, every all of the teaching, all of the Dharma is right here. 
Teachings of impermanence, interconnection, emptiness, peace, love. 
Where else could it be if it's not right here, right? In this ordinary moment, this ordinary body. 
So Ordinary Mind is the Way. 
So this is Ordinary Mel is the Way. 
I have been watching him for many years. 
Ordinary Mel is the Way. 
The way he is with short people. 
The way he is with tall people. 
The way he is with important people. 
There aren't any important people. 
The way he is with unimportant people. 
There aren't any unimportant people. 
The way he is with dogs. 
The way he is with Buddha. 
The way he is with Dharma. 
The way he is with Sangha. 
The way he is with illness. 
The way he teaches open-handed, patient, kind. 
The way he teaches close-handed, strict, exacting. 
The way he shows up for ceremonies. 
The way he shows up for work meetings. 
The way he is with Hoitsu. 
The way he was with Okusan. 
The way he is with cooking. 
The way he is with tea. 
The way he is with lineage. 
The way he is with text. 
The way he is with Buddha. 
The way he is with Dharma. 
The way he is with Sangha. 
The way he is with breath. 
This is a photo. 
You can see that this is Mel. 
And this is Okusan, who was the wife of Mel's teacher, Suzuki Roshi. 
And she passed away, say, about ten years ago. 
And I think she was almost a hundred years old. 
Maybe she was ninety-nine, or something, ninety-eight, ninety-nine. 
And Mel was ninety-one when he passed away last year. 
It's funny for me that first line. 
The way he is with short people. 
The way he is with tall people. 
So Mel was, I guess, kind of short, I don't know, for American men. 
But he once told me that he really enjoyed very tall students. 
He had a really good connection with students who were unusually big and tall. 
And so I don't know if Basia knew that, or the way he is with short people, the way he is with tall people. 
So what is it to be imperturbable? What is it to not try to get rid of our thinking, or get rid of our preferences, but to come into harmony with our thinking, to come into harmony with our preferences. 
That they're not a barrier anymore. 
Part of this moment, part of who we are, and part of the Dharma. 
So that's kind of what I wanted to share this morning. 
Thank you very much, and I think we have a few minutes. 
I don't know if there might be a few questions, but you're welcome to type in something in the chat, and it will make its way to me. 
Well, we just wait and see if there's any questions. 
I did want to share something about, you might have heard this teaching in Buddhism, about self-power and other power. 
Self-power is kind of the idea that when we practice, it's sort of up to us to make an effort, be aware, be present, let go of what needs to be let go of, build up, and cultivate what we need to build up. 
And so this is, you know, it's kind of something we do. 
And that's, you know, I think important, an important side of practice. 
And then there's this idea of other power, and it's like this radical surrender, and this radical giving over to and entrusting, and that we can never really know reality. 
You know, we're always limited in this body and mind. 
And so it's like giving, giving, giving over to the universe, and not needing to figure things out, not needing to master anything. 
And so where do you fall on this spectrum of self-power and other power? I mean, maybe we could say that a balanced practice, you know, has elements of both of these. 
You know, clearly there's something we need to do. 
There's a kind of effort and an energy that we bring to the practice, which is important. 
You know, our intention is so important. 
But then I think the danger of just self-power is we kind of can believe that it's all up to me. 
It's all up to us. 
And if something is not happening the way I want it to, what's my fault? I need to try harder. 
And if something wonderful happens, it's like, well, well, I'm so great. 
I'm a great meditator, because I can get so concentrated. 
And I remember Mel would get very angry if us, you know, angry is the right word. 
But he could be, he was very alert to the danger of kind of building up an ego around our practice. 
I think I'm so great because I'm doing this. 
I'm doing that. 
I'm sitting every day. 
Aren't I great? I'm getting really concentrated. 
And, you know, Suzuki Roshi famously said, don't ever think that you sit zazen, zazen is a meditation. 
It's zazen, sit zazen. 
Dharma practice is Dharma. 
It's not me. 
It's not the small me. 
And so maybe the self, we need the self. 
And then maybe there's, we need to be able to let go and trust and let, let things unfold and not try to control and figure everything out. 
And that's the other power. 
So, question, did you or Mel practice with Thich Nhat Hanh over the years? No. 
You know, I don't know. 
Mel, I'm sure, met him. 
Because I know Thich Nhat Hanh in the 70s and 80s came to Zen Center and came to Taosahara and I think was, was kind of a consultant or a mediator when Zen Center had various difficulties and scandals. 
And so I'm sure, I'm sure Mel interacted with him and I know he had great respect for Thich Nhat Hanh. 
One of the practice periods at Taosahara that I was with Mel when Mel was a teacher there, we studied a Thich Nhat Hanh book. 
So, thank you Nancy for the question. 
Andrew, is the teaching on no preferences also about cultivating a healthy faith and trust in one's teacher community and a wisdom of teachings? Yeah, I think it is. 
I mean, I think there's a connection between this quality of trust and sometimes, you know, faith or trust or confidence. 
When we have no trust, then we can, it's, all we have is our preferences, basically. 
You know, we don't have any other point, place, vantage point to rest. 
And so we're pulled, you know. 
But when we, when we can trust this practice and all the things, you know, the community and the teachings and that it's okay, it's gonna be okay. 
We don't have to just blindly get, be pulled around by what we want and what we don't want. 
It's okay to be still and to, and to sit in that not knowing and sort of let the moment happen to me. 
You know, that's a different, it's a different energy. 
So, and so thank you, Andrew. 
Marlene asked, what is the best way for us to cross-check our thoughts? Might it be best to just sit with thoughts, not focus on doing something? You know, I think one of the most valuable learnings for meditation is how to be with our thinking. 
You know, and how to not act on a thought is so powerful. 
It's like, that's a place of freedom. 
A thought comes up, oh, I need to scratch my nose. 
My nose is itching. 
And in, in, in some, in some meditation centers there's a big emphasis on not moving. 
You know, and again, this is a great, it doesn't mean that we're never gonna move in our life and we're just gonna be totally still. 
Of course not. 
But it's a practice of getting some freedom from our preferences. 
So to be still, to be very still and the thought comes up, I need to move. 
I need to scratch my nose, my foot is falling asleep. 
And if we have this strong intention not to move, then we notice. 
It's like we notice the thought more clearly about moving. 
If we just think, I'm gonna sit and move when I feel like it, well, we're not gonna really know that. 
We're just gonna kind of scratch. 
But if we have this intention to be still, we're gonna notice that thought. 
And if we, if we're lucky enough to see the thought as a thought, then we have a choice. 
You know, what am I gonna do? Do I let it go? Do I label it as a thinking? Do I act on it? Do I not act on it? So to see a thought as a thought, to see thinking as thinking, right there creates a place of choice, a place of freedom. 
And when I think about mindfulness and awareness, one of the greatest gifts is that it simply, that it gives us more choice. 
It gives us choice where we didn't have choice before. 
So when thinking arises, it's wonderful to notice, notice thoughts as thoughts. 
We don't have to necessarily get so involved in their content, but to just notice, oh, this is thinking. 
How, how am I relating to it? How can I relate to it? I think we can come to a place where we're not bothered by our thinking. 
You know, thoughts are gonna happen in the same way that there's a sound of the traffic on the road, there's a sound in the other room. 
You know, thoughts will happen. 
So to not be bothered by our thinking, to not be bothered by our preferences, this is great. 
It's a great, great gift of practice. 
So maybe just one more question from Wayne. 
How can I not talk so much? Yeah, yeah, you and me both, Wayne. 
I think the realm of talking and conversation, communication is, that's sort of like the advanced mindfulness practice. 
So first of all, I would say don't be too hard on yourself. 
One of, one of the, one of the great tricks or tips or tools that, that I, what I'm lucky I remember is if I'm in conversation with someone, especially if there's a sense that it may be a little bit charged or a little bit difficult or there's whatever, some energy or doesn't even have to be conflict, some other, some energy around it, is to keep some percentage of the awareness in my own body. 
You know, it's very easy if you're in a conversation, we just pull the attention just pours out into the other person or into what we're gonna say or they're speaking and we're thinking about what we want to say. 
But if I can keep, you know, 40%, 60%, 80% of the attention, the more difficult the conversation, the higher the percentage needs to be. 
If I can keep some percentage of the awareness in my own body, in my own face, my own body language, my breathing, that makes a tremendous difference for me, I've noticed. 
And then I can actually take in what's being said and my response is not just automatic, I'm thinking, it's actually coming from a little bit of a kind of coming from the belly rather than just coming from the head or coming from the heart, ideally, not just the head. 
So, you know, play with that, maybe. 
So, thank you very much. 
Appreciate being with you and this opportunity to share a little bit about my teacher and his dharma way. 
And I wish for all of us this gift of impraterrability and to be the one who is not limited by our preferences. 
We're not limited by our limitations. 
Thank you.
