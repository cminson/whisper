 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So, good evening everyone. And as we come here today, for me, a few things have come to mind. One is that it's been, it was 20 years ago, just about now, that we bought this building. It's kind of a little bit of an anniversary. It's also the first time for me to come back and teach here with people here in, you know, for a year and a half or more. And before that, almost 30 years, I taught almost every single Monday. So, that kind of is a big gap, big gap. So, it's kind of a big, wonderful to be back on a Monday evening. So, happy to see some of you, that all of you that I know, they're here. Thank you. And those of you on YouTube are watching, thank you for being here. I see the names in the chat and it's lovely to see the ones I know. So, I'll say, I'll do a little bit of a beginning to the meditation and then we'll sit quietly. And then one of the ways of understanding meditation is that initially it's preparing the ground so that we can see in some clear way. And so, we're preparing ourselves to be able to have that clarity of insight, clarity of seeing. And so, the variety of things we do at the beginning, we're kind of settling in. Some people like the language of settling in, letting go and kind of doing less just being. And some people like the language of constructing, like we're constructing our temple. We're gathering together, organizing ourself in such a way that we're kind of here in a qualitatively identifiable way. Like, I'm really here, I'm not wandering off, not thinking about the day anymore. I'm really here. And that ability, the higher, the greater the ability to really be here in the present moment, that opens the door to see in a new way. And I'll talk about that in the Dharma talk. So, in a sense, this meditation is a preparation for the seeing that will be emphasized in the talk. So, to let this body of yours become the meditation hall. The real meditation hall is here in your body. And to take a few long, slow, deep breaths in order to begin establishing yourself here. And letting your breathing return to normal. And for many people, the beginning of this process of arriving here is to relax. And not just relaxing the muscles and face and shoulders and belly, but relax into this time and place now. Settling into being here. And in a gentle, loving way, perhaps caring way, begin gathering yourself together. So, you're collecting yourself here in this time and this place. And if the mind wanders off, gently, lovingly, unheardly, invite it back. Bring it back. Collect the mind. Bring it back here with the body in the present moment. Bring the mind into the body. So, the mind is not wandering off in thought. Just here. Slowly, steadily, gathering yourself, collecting yourself here in this time and this place, moment by moment. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

As we come to the end of this sitting, One of the descriptions of meditation practice is collecting ourselves here into the present moment. A gathering together of all of who we are. So it's all together here in a singular package of presence, of attention. And one of the advantages or opportunities with this is that we're gathered together and not scattered and distracted, disconnected from ourselves. There's more of us to meet others. There's more presence, more embodiment, more receptivity, a greater capacity to listen, to attend. There's more of us gathered together to care, to be kind, respectful of others. There's more of us here to love. And it's a gift to give more of ourselves over to be with others so others can feel met, seen, heard, known, respected and cared for. May it be that this meditation we do this evening supports us so that we can bring ourselves more into a full human connection with others at a time when many people still feel very disconnected and isolated. May we bring ourselves to greater kindness and support for this world of ours. May all beings be happy. May all beings be safe. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be free. Thank you.
