 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Arriving with yourself in this moment, in the place, in the body, landing with being here, and perhaps beginning really simply, just sitting and knowing that you're sitting, and knowing that you're sitting. The knowing when there's a kind of a relaxation around that, knowing that awareness, sitting and being aware that you're sitting, then you don't have to go looking for any particular experience or sensations. How is the experience letting you know that you're sitting, receiving the experience of sitting and that will probably shift and change in each moment? So being available for how this physical body, in a way, kind of informs us that sitting is happening. You don't have to go looking. Just what's obvious? Sitting and knowing that you're sitting. Can there be a relaxation in keeping this really simple? Not a lot to do or figure out, just settling back and letting the experience of sitting and knowing that you're sitting. This experience of connecting with sitting and knowing you're sitting can also include how you are in this moment, not just the physical body. And knowing when it's just settling back and receiving what's here with sitting. Another way to explore that. What's here with sitting? Or maybe some emotions or moods also happening. Having the awareness to be broad enough to just receive what's here in this place, in this time, with sitting. This simple activity of curiosity, receiving how you are while sitting. Another checking in with yourself. It really is one of the kindest things that we can do for ourselves to give ourselves the time to receive how we are. Things may be pleasant or unpleasant, and yet the quality of the mind that is simply curious, how are you right now? That quality can hold whether things are pleasant or unpleasant. Aware of experience, what's here with yourself. Aware of physical sensations and perhaps also a little bit about how you are, how your mood, emotion, your state is in this moment. And also maybe you can be aware or recognize that quality of friendliness, care and concern for yourself with that. How are you right now? Sometimes we can feel that side of the experience too. What does it feel like to give yourself the time and space to just ask yourself how you are and be open? To not reject anything, just available. How are you right now?
