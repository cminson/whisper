 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audiodarma.org. Well, good morning and welcome back. My name is Mae Elliott and here we are in our week-long study of the foundations of Vipassana meditation. These are the basics that you would be taught if you went to most Insight or Vipassana centers in the West. So today we will be focusing on thinking. The first day was on breath, then on body, then yesterday emotions, and today the thinking mind. So let's get started with our meditation. So go ahead and find a posture that is both upright and energetic as well as relaxed. Connecting with a felt sense of the body. And touching in with the breath or your primary anchor. And then into the here and now. And blending the breath. Giving it our full attention as we drop into this moment as it is. Thanks We'll be rooting our attention with the breath, and when thoughts arise, we'll simply let them go to start. We're allowing the breath to steady the mind, to stabilize the mind. We're allowing the breath to steady the mind. Amen. Aiming and sustaining our attention on the full length of an inhale and the full length of an inhale and exhale. And the complete release of an out breath. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. We'll now do a shift in our attention, moving our awareness away from the breath. And instead, we'll open the awareness in front of us. Open the awareness in a way where it's as though you might be looking at a blank screen in the mind's eye. And soon, a thought will arise and unfold through that space, in that space. So I invite you to just notice the first thought that comes into the mind after I finish this video. So you may have noticed a thought arise, stay for a moment and pass away. If not, that's fine too. And if you did, this is mindfulness of thinking in the present moment. Confidence occurs as present moment phenomena. The content of the thought often is not in the present, but the thought itself is. Opening again now to that open space in front of you, maybe tapping into the sense of a blank screen in the mind. Go ahead and see if you can notice the first two thoughts that enter the mind after I finish this sentence. And then returning the attention to be with your anchor again. Again, now bringing up the open space, the sense of a blank screen. And see if you can pay attention to every thought that comes up after I finish this sentence. See if you can maintain the awareness for a little while. And again now returning to your primary anchor, maybe the breath. You may have found that you were able to be with the thoughts and you might have gotten lost in thought and that's okay. Mindfulness of thinking is a very slippery object as we're so apt to get lost in the content. So for the rest of this meditation, see you're allowed to think. See if you can look straight at thinking. Being aware, ah, this is thinking. You might imagine that you are watching a group of people standing around and having a conversation with each other. That you're standing maybe 15 feet away. So you're not lost in the content of what they're talking about. Just see the process of them speaking to each other. You can relate to the mind in that way. Just watching this process of thinking from a little bit of a distance. And at any point if you find yourself getting too lost in thought or if you need to just ground in the breathing or if the thoughts subside, you can return to the breath. As you do this, you might take a look to see. Do you think in images or in words? 70 cents. Do your thoughts have a tone of voice? Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? Do you notice any physical sensations associated with the voice? Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? Are there emotions that go along with the thinking? Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? Do the thoughts have a strong hook? Are they very compelling? They pull you in. Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? Do you find yourself with the desire to keep thinking, wanting to continue with the content? Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? This might be rehearsing or planning, maybe judging. And when the thought moves on, we see what happens next. Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft? Do you feel like the voice is harsh or soft?
