 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. So a warm welcome to everybody to a happy hour. And sometimes when we think about love and kindness, we think about, as you know, I'm an individual here and I'm sending love and kindness to an individual over there. This real distinct set of me versus the person over there, the lovable being, or sometimes we do love and kindness for ourselves, but could also be the, you know, a friend, a difficult person, a neutral person, etc. So sometimes when we're doing love and kindness practice, there can be a distinct set of separation or a sense of, like, maybe I'll use this word boundaries between me and everybody else. But there's also a way in which boundaries can show up that are painful. So this word boundaries is tricky. I wish I had a better one because sometimes boundaries are really important. We need to say, you know, I can tolerate this and I can't tolerate that. And you can interact with me in a certain way, but not in other ways. So those types of boundaries are really important, but there can be a delineation. Thank you, Nicholas. So there might be a different way in which there might be a delineation. There might be a separation. And that is when these boundaries show up as us versus them, and it's laced with a sense of ill will, maybe, maybe a little bit of hostility, or maybe there's a sense of collapsing into me and my tribe and everybody else out there is somehow other and bad. Somehow I'm just using this kind of generic word bad. So when we have these kinds of distinctions of me against the world, me versus you, us versus them, it's often a sense of defensiveness that goes with that. There's a sense of maybe some aggressiveness or some shutting down. And those types of boundaries, delineations, separations, don't offer the best outcomes. When we're in our life or in society, when we have those senses really strong. So loving kindness practice without really... It might like, let's say from the outside, it might seem like how does this work where there's an individual who's setting good will, who's sending kindness to another. It might seem that that kind of perpetuates this sense of distinction, this separation. But loving kindness practice really helps soften and helps make some of these distinctions more porous. As we start to connect with the common humanity. And to be sure, I'm not saying that we have to become best friends with other people that have harmed us or maybe have experienced some disrespect, some racism, some oppression. I'm not saying that we have to all come together as one kind of happy family. There's a lot of healing, a lot of respect that needs to be done. But loving kindness practice is a way in which we can create boundaries that are healthy, boundaries that are supportive and that are helpful. That doesn't diminish anybody, doesn't diminish ourselves, and nor does it dehumanize others. And not only between us and others, but loving kindness practice can help soften some of the boundaries or the distinctions between different aspects of ourselves. There's often a way in which we kind of want to disown a part of ourselves, maybe a part of our history, a part of difficult emotions. Maybe there's some really deep broken hearts that sometimes we want to just separate ourselves. Like everything would be fine if those would go away, but of course it doesn't work that well. Right? If it worked well, you wouldn't be here. You would have just separated from those and gone on when you're married in life. But so this idea of loving kindness as a way that helps to keep the boundaries that are helpful and supportive. So we don't lose discernment. We don't lose wisdom. But it also helps us to see that some of the separations we have are a way that don't offer the best outcomes, don't offer the most freedom, the most freedom for ourselves and the most freedom for others. And this is where the peace is, is where there's the freedom, where we don't feel trapped, where we don't feel like everything will be fine as long as I am completely separate from others. And then we have to organize our lives to make sure that we're separate from the others, whoever the others happen to be. And I want to say there can be some wisdom, right, where we really should be separate from others, but can we be separate from others without our hearts being closed? Can we use wisdom and discernment to say it's better if there's some physical separation, maybe some mental separation. I'm not thinking about these others, but can we do that with a peaceful heart? Can we do that with a wise heart? And loving kindness practice is one of the ways that we cannot find our way there. Find our way with all the other beings on this planet. So, well that is an introduction. Let's do some meditation practice. So, taking another upright posture. A posture that offers stability, some balance, some ease, as well as some uprightness, either literally or figuratively. And bringing the attention to the body in a general way, just feeling into the posture and noticing how does it feel to sit here and now. And then in a more specific way, we can do a light body scan as a way to help us connect with the body. Of course the body is always here. Taking it in around the eyes and the jaw, places we commonly hold tension. And with the shoulders, and in the shoulder blades slide down the back. Lower back, the lower back, the chest, the belly. Can there be some softness and openness? And the feeling that pressure against the body, the chair, cushion, or whatever it is we're sitting on. The upper legs, the lower legs, the feet, feeling grounded, connected with the feet. The arms, the hands. And then resting the attention on the sensations of breathing. Feeling the expansion and contraction of the chest or the abdomen. Or feeling the air going in and out of the nose. Tuning into, what does an inhale feel like? What does an exhale feel like? And then when the mind wanders, just very gently, simply begin again with the sensations of breathing. And then to begin our loving kindness practice. Bring to mind a lovable being, somebody with whom you have an uncomplicated relationship. This could be somebody you know. Maybe somebody you know about, an author, a teacher, a leader. Or maybe it's an imaginary kitten, puppy, baby. And to connect with this lovable being. Bringing the being to mind, visually. And then to help support the heart and mind to stay connected with this well-wishing we have for this lovable being. Can I repeat these phrases? May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. Sometimes it's helpful to check in with the body and see if there is any warmth or openness. Maybe some self-inning, literally or figuratively. And if so, to allow that to be a support. Now that to be a foundation perhaps, at which this well-wishing, this goodwill, this loving kindness is fueled or supported by that sense of softness, more spaciousness. And it's perfectly fine. If you're not feeling anything in particular, it's perfectly fine. Maybe reconnecting with the loveable being. And then to expand our loving kindness for a good friend. Sometimes our relationships with our friends are just a little bit more snags. Which is fine, it's part of human relations. To extend loving kindness, metta, to our good friend, bringing them to mind. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be safe. May you be happy. May you be healthy. May you live with ease. May you be healthy. May you be healthy. You're welcome to use different phrases. Maybe there's other words that resonate more with you. And then to extend our loving kindness to ourselves. Just as we send goodwill to loveable being and good friends, we send it to ourselves. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. And we know our complete humanity. And we know our complete humanity. And we know our complete humanity. May I be safe. May I be happy. May I be healthy. May I live with ease. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be good. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. May I be healthy. And then we'll end with a little bit of equanimity practice. Bring to mind somebody that you care about, but sometimes they're a little bit bothersome or irksome. So not the most difficult person that you know. For this person, we'll use this phrase. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices for you. And then to end this meditation, feel your feet on the ground. Feel the pressure of the chair or cushion against your body. And when you're ready, you can gently open your eyes. So this idea of loving kindness, in a way to kind of soften some of the distinctions, delineations, separations that we do, that have a little bit of a, are not just about freedom and peace, but are about maybe there's some fear or, and to be sure, I mean, safety is so important, but maybe I'm trying to convey, right, there's boundaries that are important, but can we do it in a way that we don't harden our hearts, other people on the other side, and maybe even some of these boundaries we don't need. So, and this is part of what it means to have some wisdom is to recognize which are the ones that are really wise and supportive and important for my life, and which are the ones that maybe I inherited from life, from whatever reason. And we think that, you know, on the other side, somehow or less than or different or somehow not as worthy. So loving kindness is a way that can really help support this process of having boundaries that are supportive, and having other ones become more porous ones that aren't so supportive. So this can be helpful to talk about with others this idea of boundaries and this one word that can convey a number of different meanings. We have one meaning but maybe there's nuance in the way that we use it or understand it in our lives. So I'd like to put you into some breakout rooms where you have a chance to talk with others about this for 12 minutes. And it can be helpful just to say one thing, and then let it go to the next person, and then they say one thing and then let it go to the next person they say one thing, and then it comes back around to you. So in that way, there's can be a sharing, and maybe a creation of something together. Otherwise, sometimes the introverts end up not really speaking and there isn't as much opportunity for sharing an interaction with others. So, for this purpose, how about if we, sorry I'm doing a few things here at once, trying to take care of this. So in this way these kind of breakout rooms are kind of, you know, they're contrived they're not our usual way of speaking, but it's a way in which everybody has an opportunity to participate and maybe something new can arise when these different voices come together. So, let's go in the order of the number of characters in your screen name. If you have a long screen name, you'll go last. Okay, here we go.
