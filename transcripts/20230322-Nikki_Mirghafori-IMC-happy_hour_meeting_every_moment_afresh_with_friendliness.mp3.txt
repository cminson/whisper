 The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City, California. Please visit our website at audioderma.org. Here we go. Great. Welcome. Hello, everyone. Lovely to be back with you. I've missed you. As I mentioned at the beginning, various things were happening the past week, including on Monday, the Persian New Year, Nooruz, which is on the vernal equinox. It's the first day of spring, which was on Monday. So happy spring to you all. Happy spring. Yeah. So let's start meditating together. Let's begin. And more words will, the theme will emerge. So let's arrive. Let's arrive together in this body, in this moment in time. Arriving, arriving every moment, each moment a new arrival, every moment like spring. Every breath is like spring, every sensation in this body. Fresh, new, never like this before. And we have a beginner's mind, beginner's mind, a mind that is fresh. Like the green grass. Like blossoms, cherry blossoms in springtime. Fresh, new blossoming in meeting this moment in new. Let us meet sensations of our body. Resting on the earth, on the cushion, our sit bones, on the cushion, on the chair, our feet on the earth, bottom of our feet. And new. And we meet the sensations of our body. The sensations of this breath in the abdomen. Like the spring breeze, fresh, new sensations. The in breath, the entire in breath and the entire out breath. As well as the pause in between the in breath and out breath, out breath and in breath. Opening the door of your heart. The breath, the sensations of the breath, however they arrive. Staying with them. I can honor a guest before meeting for the first time. And we have a childlike interest, curiosity, delight at this world. In this inner world, the breath, sensations. Receiving it with ease, relaxation, softness. And we meet this moment. Can I meet with this moment like a friend? Can I meet this moment with friendliness? Whatever is arising in this moment. If you are meeting a friend you haven't seen for the first time, for a long time. Without being attacked because of all being. This is love, this is love and that is love and that is love. I know love and that is love, but always you want to love it. You won't be upset that your friend is tired or cranky or hurting or you're just happy to be with them. Oh, it's okay, however they are. It's freshness of appreciation. You need whatever this moment brings, even if it's a crowd of sorrows in our heart. Meeting with friendliness, the fresh. Thank you for watching. you Maybe your mind is scattered and you meet your mind with friendliness, meeting like a friend, might be tired, scattered, it's okay. Love your mind. Love your heart. You're doing their best to be present. You're doing your best to be present. Meeting the breath with friendliness, kindness, appreciation, imbuing the breath with appreciation. Breathing in appreciation, breathing out appreciation. You're doing your best to be present. You're doing your best to be present. And whatever arises, if it's judgment, I'm not doing this right or this is terrible or boring and you meet this, whatever arises with kindness, with friendliness, meeting like your friend, your friend who's cranky right now, it's okay, it's okay. You still love your friend. I meet this moment with friendliness, generosity of heart. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You're doing your best. You all thank you for your practice. So tonight we, or this moment in time, whatever your time zone is, we practiced with a couple of themes. One was meeting the moment, meeting whatever arises in the body, in the heart, in the mind. Whatever arises in this sphere of experience with kindness, with friendliness, like a friend. So in that theme, we brought in a sense of freshness, a sense of inspired by it being the first couple of days of spring, as if we're meeting this moment fresh, whatever's arising fresh, this childlike interest, freshness, curiosity. Because as adults, we kind of get, I don't know, bored perhaps, or we lose our, the freshness. We have to rekindle it. We have to remind ourselves that this moment has never been like this before and will never be. If you spend some time with a young person, you'll just see the sense of delight of anything, any little game or any little toy. There's a sense of wonder. So this invitation to meet each moment with beginner's mind as if spring has arisen fresh can be very helpful as we go around in our daily life and say, dah, bah, humbug, yeah, it's Wednesday. It's, oh wow, this moment is fresh. It's never been like this. And it will never be like this again. We just take it for granted. We think we're going to be alive for so many more springs. Who knows? Who knows? Thank you for joining for this practice. So I'd like to invite us now to turn as we meet this moment with internally we have met it with kindness as much as possible, as much as possible. Can we turn? Can we befriend? Whatever arises, can we meet others like a friend? Can we meet this moment? Can we meet a couple of other human beings like friends? Whether or not you know them, you've seen them before or not, meet them as if for the first time without the assumptions, presumptions that we have, oh, this person is like that. This is what they're going to talk about. No, just what if you just try that out for size? It's easier for people you don't know so well to meet them afresh, meet them anew with friendliness. And then maybe you can practice in the sandbox and then take it to your family and friends. If there are some buttons that you have, buttons that are pushed by some friends, family and colleague, maybe you can just try on for size for a few minutes. What if you met them afresh without all the expectations, presumptions? With friendliness. So that's the invitation or the small groups that we'll engage with in a moment. And the prompt is what was this practice like for you? You can share maybe a sentence or two and the next person go alphabetical and the next person will share something and the next person, or you can just say pass and hold silent presence. But those who are receiving, those who are hearing, hear the person as if it's fresh, it's new, without presumptions, without thinking about what you're going to say, just friendliness, friendliness and spring. So these two, bring them in, play around, see how you can play with that, make it work for you and I'd be interested in your reflections. So I'm going to create breakout rooms and invite you as always to be kind, to be kind to yourselves, to be kind to each other and I'm going to recreate the rooms. Hold on a second. Here we go. Okay, let's try this. All right. Okay, be kind to yourselves, to each other and about to open the rooms. Here we go. Okay, the rooms are closed. Everybody's back. Welcome back, everyone. We'd love to open the space and also the chat if you'd like to share exploring this. What was it like bringing the idea of meeting others with beginner's mind fresh as well as this friendliness? Ali, please. Hello, hello everyone. So I just love the beginning of how you started to start the meditation and saying that they'll see what comes up, kind of like allowing and that's what I did all the way through the meditation and towards the end I just came up with like a, with the spring renewal, you know, and the Persian tradition as you mentioned with this spring. So what do I have to say grateful, be grateful for the Sangha and then it came to me that made a spring every moment, you know, in our lives. So that came to me, you know, and then you kind of like, you know, started in that team and in the group it came to me that the Hindu tradition, one of those sages has said that every moment you open your eyes, you create a new world and that is very true. So made that be our case for this lovely space here you have, Nikki and the other teachers and then we're the greatest Sangha in the whole world. The spring is spring every moment. Yeah, thank you, Ali. Thank you so much. I just thought I'll add that, sorry about that. No, that was beautiful. Okay. That was absolutely beautiful. I still appreciate. And this is a May spring be springing every moment and actually it is. And as you said, this Hindu saying is that actually every moment it is, it's just that we don't pay attention to it in that way. We're like, oh, humdrum, humdrum, same thing. Okay, I'm going to open my eyes again. No, actually it's, we're creating worlds. We're creating new worlds every moment. So yeah, exactly. So let's have actually that perspective of freshness. This show is not going to go on for that long. So we might as well. It's always springing new every moment. We just don't appreciate it. So thank you so much for bringing that beautiful. Thank you. And as they say in Persian, happy new year, happy new year. Yes. New day. New day, exactly. New year means new day. It's all new day. Thank you. Thank you so much. Lovely. Any other reflections? And also type them in chat, either to me privately or to everyone, if you like. Claire. Thank you. I'll be very brief, but this was not what I talked about in our group, but the last chair, Ali Sher reminded me to just to mention, and I've talked about this before, I circulated gratitude list with two friends every day. And I've been doing it for years now. It really forces one to look at what is working well in the day, rather than things that might be going wrong or just the monotony of it. You really have to focus and think through the details. And it's worked so beautifully for me in terms of seeing the day every day fresh. Yeah, yeah. Lovely. And also what it becomes after you do this practice for a long time, which I think you're alluding to, but just to unpack that for everyone, is that maybe at first one only looks at what is going well, but then later, it's not just that. We also actually start to appreciate it. So many things are going well. I mean, it's just like, oh my goodness, the preponderance of fresh and new and wonderful things. It's just like, wow, you start to notice more. So I think that it's important how this practice actually changes our mind instead of, I think some people maybe do this practice, like, well, I've already been grateful for this and that and like, oh, what's new? Like actually, no, it shifts and changes the way you see. So I appreciate you bringing that in. Thank you. Yeah. What else? Any other last reflections before we close? And you can also type them in chat, as I was saying, they're publicly or privately. Any insights from this practice? Any insights? Anything different? What was it like to meet others in a group with beginner's mind, even if maybe you had met them before, perhaps you should try that out for size or no, you just went out the window after 30 seconds of being in the group. That can happen. Okay. All right. Well, let's, let's bring our time together to a close. So thank you all. Thank you all for your practice. Thank you for, for cultivating your hearts towards kindness, friendliness, meeting this moment internally and externally and new and like a friend. May all things be well. May all beings be free, including ourselves. Thanks everyone. Happy New Year. Happy Noru's new day, new moment, every moment. Take good care of yourselves. See you on Friday. Bye.
