The following talk was given at the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood
City, California. Please visit our website at audiodharma.org.
So, you know, what what we do in our practice is to look at things, look at
experience that's in the way of freedom. So, for instance, a mind that's caught up
in aversion or suffering is kind of that's the that's what's in the way of
freedom and we find our way towards freedom by studying what's in the way of
freedom by getting familiar with the experience of aversion and then wisdom
begins to grow and develop that supports the mind to begin to have a new
relationship with aversion to begin to recognize it's not so helpful to that
it that it begins to fall apart and it's very similar with in a way around the
teaching of not self. You know, we don't go looking for not self. The Buddha
did say that the it is through not understanding the this truth of not
self that it is a truth it's it's not it's not something that we have to get
rid of the self it's just it's it's not it's it's not what we think it is
whatever we are taking to be self is not what we think it is and so that is a
misunderstanding essentially and so the the Buddha pointed to that misunderstanding
around the sense of self being a thing a permanent abiding entity pointed to
that misunderstanding as one of the fundamental reasons that we suffer and
so rather than trying to find the not self we explore what we take to be self
we explore that side of the experience and so that's what we've been largely
doing the last few weeks of this discussion so exploring what we take to be
self helps us to understand that the the experience that we take to be self
doesn't function in the way that we might think it does so we begin to learn
something about those misunderstandings those misunderstandings about the sense of
self
the sense of self we could say the Buddha used the term identity view as one of
the ways he talked about the sense of self the Pali Sakya Diti and Diti is a
commonly used term that refers to view the Sakya part is often translated as
identity or personality so Sakya Diti personality view identity view and he's
pointing to it as a view that this is one one of the things that we take to be
self is nothing more than a view a belief of some aspect of our experience
being kind of identified with as I or me or mine and in many places in the
teachings the Buddha pointed to views in in many forms views about who we are
what we can do what other people can do views about the nature of the world views
in general when we identify with them and attach to them are one of the main
sources of conflict in the world I think we can see this in our culture right
now in the United States especially how how much views are contributing to
suffering contributing to not out not war so much but you know I think we use do
contribute to wars but in this country you know to contribute to to just a lot
of separation a lot of anger a lot of hatred that is happening because people
are have or holding to views and are kind of reified around them reinforced
around them so that they can't take in other perspectives or they aren't
willing to try to to meet to have other different other perspectives so the
Buddha spoke about views in general as being a source of conflict and many of
the views that create suffering and pain in our world do have to do with
identities have to do with our sense of who we are what we're capable of and a
sense of who other people are so this is this is kind of the the exploration
I'd like to look at tonight we've been talking about looking at in the past
few weeks around how we create identities for ourselves but there's
also another form of selfing that we could call other ring that we also
attribute qualities we have beliefs around other people and I'd like to
propose this isn't exactly in the Buddhist teachings but what I have kind
of explored in my own experience this comes out some from my own practice my
own exploration of my sense of self is that when I am kind of strongly
identifying somebody else as other there is a sense of self when a sense of
other springs up it is it is a sense of self that's created you can't have
other without having self and so they come together so so this to me has been
a kind of an interesting way to explore aspects of a sense of self that I don't
normally think of when I when I start to see in particular the mind projecting
or using they them language or those people or something that's a little bit
of a clue that there's there's something going on that there's an identity
going on some kind of a holding to something going on and so the the
othering piece kind of betrays a clinging to some kind of an identity here
there was a question that was submitted just today about not self in the context
of a collective identity and I'm not going to explicitly respond to that
directly right now but some of what I talk about will will be connected to
that be connected to that sense of group identity so when we when we grow up
we grow up in a particular context a group perhaps you know it might it might
be you know just where we where we live we're surrounded by particular people
or the people that we socialize with we have a kind of a group that that we
are familiar with and in a way this forms this this has a piece of forming
our our identity of who we are based on based on the ideas the views the beliefs
the things that the people around us do it's kind of like it's our culture
in a sense you know we we we grow up first perhaps in our own family or in
an extended family or or in a particular community where we are exposed
to certain things more than other things so this is you know this is a
conditioning it's part of our conditioning this is you know the the
Buddhist teachings talk a lot about conditioning how we are shaped how we
how our views our ideas our beliefs are formed and a lot of that are our views
of ourselves our views about the world are formed based on the community that
we grow up in so we could call that in effect a kind of our initial collective
identity our initial identity with the group we all kind of form one one one
teacher that not a Buddhist teacher but a teacher of understanding diversity
Shakil Shudri has a beautiful book called deep diversity that I really
appreciate and in that book he talks about you know kind of that we each
grow up in our own tribe he uses the language of tribe you know that we're
surrounded by people who tend to look like us who we are shaped by the way
that group does things and so that is what we grow up thinking of as normal
that's what we grow up thinking of as the way people do things and that's what
we're exposed to and so that that is kind of our initial shaping and it makes
sense that for all of us whatever community we grow up in that that that's
where we feel comfortable now that's what we've been exposed to that's what
we've kind of that's what we've been shaped into and so that's where we
that's where we feel comfortable so we tend to gravitate towards that
comfort and familiarity this is a very familiar piece around you know we go
to what's pleasant the the Buddhist teaching on you know what what is
pleasant we tend to like that we want more of what's unpleasant we tend to
not like that we we tend to not want to go towards that and so whatever
we're shaped by whatever we become comfortable with and our families and
our collective community that's kind of where we might gravitate and I know
that this is not always the case there's certain times people grow up in in
environments that are not that are that are traumatic and that are somebody is
basically just surviving and there's not a sense of comfort in that so that that
that also does happen and that's a different kind of shaping perhaps a
shaping to want to find something different find find your way out of
that so I'm talking I'm just talking more in general here about often how
we're shaped by our communities by our families and so we tend to have this
bias towards the familiar that's you know this is what this is what normal is
in a way we tend to to have that kind of shaping we all tend to have some kind of
shaping in that way it's this is human this is human this is is not you know
what we grow up with I think in this group I've told this story when I was in
Peace Corps I spent some time in a village that I was in the Peace Corps in
the South Pacific where the community there's Melanesian very dark-skinned
people and there was a baby and mostly there weren't too many white people
around and there was a baby that was born who while I was there who was
given my name so she became my namesake and I went back she was born I got to
see her but then I went back you know she hadn't she didn't remember me you
know it was like you know months it was like six months later and I think she
had not seen another white face another white person in that whole six months
because when she saw me she just burst into tears it was like she was afraid
and I could just only imagine like you know if she'd only ever seen these like
warm dark faces and here's my face that looks like a ghost or something it's
like it just looks weird it looks wrong and so even at the age even at a very
young age you know we what what we're surrounded by what we've become familiar
with that's what feels right and normal and when something is out of that range
it feels different it feels uncomfortable and so this is just human this kind of
conditioning and so it can be useful to reflect to spend some time reflecting on
what kind of conditioning what kind of collective essentially did you grow up
in what was that shaping that you had mostly we don't think about that until
we start to meet other until we start to meet other other groups other people and
then perhaps you know sometimes it might be you know if you're in a situation
where your so in in in my experience I didn't see very many people of color as a
as a young child and so seeing somebody who who did not look like me that did
create a kind of a sense of separation of that person is different from me that
person is different from my group from from my community so so there is there
could be that sense of of separation there in in this in the in the other ring
so so I think often I think other ring can occur on a on a personal level you
know it can occur you know just an individual to individual but I think
often the other ring happens based on based on group identities based on you
know what we're familiar with from our family and you know what kinds of many
kinds of things perhaps in your skin color gender perceived differences in
economic or social status these kinds of things might might be some of these
differences of of self another perhaps body language how somebody expresses
themselves in body the accent of which somebody with which somebody speaks that
might be a way that somebody is seen as other or different than me the way
people dress all kinds of things that you know almost that we that a lot of
these ways of what we think of as maybe kind of normal you know each of us
having some kind of view of normal anything that's different than that and
it can be many many things many of these things that I just mentioned any many
of those things can create that sense of self and other so we we we may tend to
have a kind of a bias to go towards or away from what feels different we may
tend to go towards people we perceive to be like us or we may tend to go it's
possible it you know certain certain times it may be that we tend to
gravitate towards people that we think of are very not like us because of of
again perhaps a sense of maybe a feeling of constriction in our own identity
a constriction in our own place that we have whatever tribe or whatever
collective we have we have grown up with so this is this exploration around
othering you know it's it's important to just realize and I hope it's it's
clear in what I'm describing that this is just a natural process that it's
conditioning that we do this what is most important I think is to be aware of
it and to be aware of the impact that it can have on ourselves on others not
only so you know there's first there's just this separation of the sense of
that person is not like me you know or that person is not like us there can be
the us them the me you the us them you know there can be there can be different
ways this othering kind of has a flavor to it now it might just simply be you
know a little bit of a sense of startle oh that's different I'm not familiar
with that kind of like the six month old baby seeing my face you know my guess
is that that six month old baby didn't have too many views and opinions about
white people at that point but there was still a startle so there can be you
know just the the impact of difference can create a sense of fear of anxiety
of separation so that's important just to be aware of that piece of it that the
sense of that's different oh you know oh does it make you feel uncomfortable so
noticing that experience if you're seeing you know this is this is something
we can explore in our in our lives in our practices we're going through our day
and seeing people how do we respond when we see somebody who looks different
from us or acts different from us or dresses differently from us or behaves
differently from us what happens is there a little bit of a construction be
aware of that it's not something to berate ourselves for but it is something to
be aware of but it's even more important in some ways to notice or to be aware
because along with that sense of separation often kind of conditioned in
with an us them me other is some kind of view or belief about other about who
the other is about what they do about how they are as people so there's there's
often a whole host of almost like subconscious at times views beliefs around
they and them when we're when we're having that separation and so really important
to recognize not only the sense of that separation but also are their views are
their beliefs in there so becoming aware of this whole process I think for myself
becoming aware of that they them language has been helpful becoming aware
when I notice that of of a little perhaps sometimes actually the first thing I
notice is is a little bit of a a little bit of a feeling of separation you know
with that that that sense of othering there's a little bit of a sense of of
guardedness or something a little bit of an emotional response and so that can be
one of the first things that can be useful to be aware of and and to let
let the mindfulness kind of be curious about that for a period of time I was
exploring this when I would I would see somebody and have that little bit of a
sense of that person's different from me I had read a suggestion to kind of like
instead of seeing that person and often I think what happens is we see we see
when there's othering going on we are seeing that person not as an individual
not as who they are not as what they're actually doing but from a perspective
of a whole bunch of views and beliefs and ideas about them views and beliefs
and ideas about if we're if we're taking them as a member of a group for
instance views and ideas and beliefs about the group we're seeing not the
individual but we're seeing them as a member of a group sometimes and so this
is this is this is not seeing things as they are it's it's it's bringing views
and ideas and concepts as an overlay and not receiving the actual experience of
the person but taking in information from a view from a perspective this is a
very familiar pattern actually in in in our minds any kind of perspective can
filter in certain things and you know let us let us take in certain things and
not other things so the the the piece that I found really fun to explore as I
saw this as I saw this kind of like a little bit of separation a little bit of
a sense of of othering the question that I was encouraged to reflect on and
this came from the book deep diversity that I mentioned a few minutes ago is
to ask a simple question that's kind of personal and just really neutral it's
like I wonder what kind of vegetables that person likes this ended up being
an amazingly powerful tool to it like it broke through the sense of looking at
somebody through a view and created curiosity I wonder who they are I
wonder maybe they like carrots maybe they maybe they like zucchini who knows
you know it's like but it just created a little bit of curiosity that broke
through the habit of seeing from that perspective that habitual perspective of
other we can feel shame when we see these kind of habits at work you know that
these these biases in our mind to have a sense of of separation or a sense of
distance when we see somebody who doesn't look like us but again you know
remembering this is based in a very human pattern so it is just conditioned the
seeing of it is how the whole thing can become transformed and and healed in
many ways how that separation between self and other can be healed and be kind
of actually meeting people not as other but as kind of like an exchange of of
actual experience with somebody not so much through our lens of ideas but the
actual meeting one person to another so it needs to be seen these patterns these
habits of the habitual pattern of identifying with our own collective our
own group and perhaps othering with others it needs to be seen it can be seen
with mindfulness held with mindfulness and a different perspective so it's
it's like we start to see through seeing the othering we start to see ways in
which we're holding a kind of a cold it my my sense of the cell the othering is
that in many times when I'm when I find that selfing and othering happening
there is a kind of a protection a protection identity arising I need to
be careful I need to watch out or something so you know it's something
like that that is happening here internally being projected on something
externally it's so humbling to see these these views at work but seeing them
is way better than not seeing them and there's there's so much to learn and
and what I've seen too is that you know that simple question that I that I I
started to play with it was so interesting to just have that little bit of
curiosity it was it was it was within a few months I found that my entire
relationship to others radically changed and and it wasn't it wasn't
something I had to try to do it just began to shift it just began to alter
so one of the things and this is the last piece because I see we're over by
minutes I apologize for that but I do want it to I do want to just point to
this exploration around selfing and othering you know it's not just about
opening to our own struggles and suffering because this pattern around
selfing and othering is a big contributor to suffering in the world that
this pattern around othering taking people to be different foreign or
strange or just not who I am you know that that impacts the other person too
it creates suffering externally at times not always but but we're seeing a lot
of that right now we are seeing a lot of that right now the suffering that
happens in that othering it's not just about freeing ourselves our own hearts
from suffering it is also about not putting that actions into the world that
contribute to suffering externally also so it's time to stop and think I'll
look at we'll look at questions again next week so there's a little more time
maybe that's how we have to do this because it seems to me that the the
the conversation when I'm offering a teaching it's it seems to take some
time to unwrap that so the next time we can do some do some questions
