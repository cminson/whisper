 Well, tonight I wanted to talk about Anatta for Beginners. Anatta is one of the most, it's one of the things that the Buddha taught earliest in his career and he returned to it often and it has, in one of the shorter lists, there are lots of lists in Buddhism and Anatta is on one of the lists, the list of the three characteristics of conditioned existence, Anatta, Anichenduka, or I'll say the translation for later, Anatta, impermanence and unsatisfactoriness or suffering. So part of what I want to talk about tonight is how we translate Anatta and also talk about how the Buddha used the term in his teachings and look at how he thought about views in general. Partly because Anatta has a bad reputation as being a really hard thing and also, probably I think that looking at the way that the Buddha used it in his teachings, I like the way that that kind of gives us an insight into how we thought and how he was teaching people. So one of the reasons Anatta has a bad reputation is because people think it's a doctrine and that's really easy to understand why it can be, people can think it's a doctrine. We kind of have a built-in need for doctrines. We're always looking to experts for pronouncements about how the world is and especially from a Western perspective, we've got the philosophers, we're always looking for the ultimate way to explain everything. So Descartes said, I think therefore I am. And you've got the physicists looking at string theory and quarks and trains. Okay, this is it. And you've got the molecular biologists looking at DNA and says this is the basis of life. So everybody's always looking for something that's authoritative and people kind of expect the Buddha to be doing the same thing because he is an expert, right? So I mean, what good is an expert without an expert opinion? And those of us that come from a Christian tradition or grew up knowing people with that, there's also this kind of this expectation. There's a doctrinal expectation. There's our creeds in Christianity and you say what you believe. And that's what you believe is part of being a Christian, right? It's the Apostles Creed or the Nicene Creed. I grew up, we said one of those every Sunday that was part of saying what you believed was part of the worship service. And part of that is believing in a life after death. So the Buddha is a great religious figure. Maybe he's got creeds too. Maybe there are things to believe to be a Buddhist. So maybe this no soul thing that we hear about, maybe that's part of something I need to believe in to be a Buddhist or something. And as part of this, we hear all kinds of stuff. The Buddha said, we are all one. He may have said that. Or the Buddha maybe here, the Buddha said, well, the Buddha said there's no soul, but there's no individual souls. There's really this big soul, and we're all kind of ripples in the big soul. So it's all kind of, we're all connected in a way or something like that. And I'll tell you that I don't think that's what the Buddha was doing, but let's look at how that expectation came about and then look at the suitors and see how we really taught. And I think there'll be something here we can take home tonight and use rather than get all confused about all this technical terminology, which is all too easy to do. So I think the first thing to do is let's look at the nada, where it comes from, the Pali roots for the word nada, and see how it could have these different translations, because some people translated as no soul, others as different something else. So the first syllable is on, which is kind of a general Pali negation. It's kind of like on in English. And depending on the sounds following, sometimes it's just ah, so a kusla, a rupa, anata. So this is not, this is on, ah, whatever ah, is an ah, ah, meant variously as a pronoun like myself or yourself, general purpose pronoun like that. And then with the, if you had a capital A, it could mean like soul. And there was a in the, especially in the Sanskrit version of this atman as a long history of being part of the kind of the individual expression of the cosmic soul. It's deep inside of us. If I have that right. So when people saw when the, perhaps on the translator saw the anata, one kind of Suta, they said, Oh, wow, it must be a famous, a big doctrine about no soul. Because in a way, it kind of fits in with what some of the Buddha, with what the Buddha said, but only if you don't read too much of the suitors, only if you don't read too many of the scriptures, do you have that idea. So, so far we have the idea that anata means anata. And there's a temptation to translate it as, as, as no soul. But let's look at the suitors here and see what actually what he did. And, oh yeah, okay. And see if I'm skipping anything here. Okay, for that, I want to back up and tell the story of how the Buddha got to be a Buddha. And because all this is kind of relevant, allows me to tell the story. So the Buddha was born a prince. And some of the brahmins that came to his kind of one that when the king first showed his son to the subjects, some of the brahmins said, well, he's going to be either a universal monarch or an enlightened being a Buddha. And one guy said, no, he's going to be a Buddha for sure. His name was Kodanya. And so the father decided to keep his son kind of protected from everything in the outside world so that he wouldn't decide to go out and be a spiritual being. He wanted, he wanted a son to be, to be his heir. So the Buddha had a letter charmed life. He had his own palaces, one for the summer, one for the winter and one for the rainy season. Never went anywhere, but where he could see what the world was like. But when he was 29, he saw in succession, he saw an old man, he saw somebody that was sick and then he, and he saw a wandering, wandering monk or ascetic. And the sick people and the old man, he just, he hadn't seen this before. I don't know how he got to be 29 without seeing somebody that was sick or dying, but all of a sudden, this is, this is a shock to him. Everybody around him was young. So all of a sudden he woke up and says, wow, I'm going to be like this too. What's the, what, what's ahead for me? What do I want to be? And when he saw this wandering ascetic or there are plenty of spiritual seekers just wandering around India at the time, he says, maybe that's the way I want to find that. He could have gone to the Brahmins that were around his father's court. Brahmins were the upper caste and the Indian society and the priests were a part of that caste. And they were just kind of like this with the very tightly connected with the ruling class. So the Buddha would have had plenty of chances to see Brahmins priests and ask him questions and stuff, but that wasn't what he wanted to do. So one night he snuck off at Hackens to be the night that his son was born. So he's not, doesn't get a lot of points for being, taking care of his son, but he snuck off and went into the woods and he was looking for, looking for teachers. And there were a couple of, there were lots of different schools in India at the time. And in one, a lot of them had variations on a theme that there was a soul that was inside and inside and it was covered up by, covered up by the delusions of the mind or the impurities of the body, or it was just covered up by material, materiality. Anyway, the soul was in there. There was a soul, some people called it Atman, it had to be released from the body or the mind. So the first thing he did was he went out and found one of the best meditation teachers in his part of India and to learn how to master the mind. And he went with this teacher all the way up to the top of the teacher's capability. He went up seven levels in this ranking scheme of concentration practices. And the teacher said, this is great. You want to be my co-teacher? I'll sit here with me, be my peer, teach my students. And he says, no, he says, this isn't doing it. You know, I came to master the mind to find out true freedom. The guy said, well, there is one more step, but I don't teach it. So he went to the guy that did and he mastered that. He mastered that eighth step. And at the end he talked to teachers, well, this is it. No, this is it. And the Buddha said, no, there's got to be more. So he left, respectfully left and went and found he was going to do the other way of finding out, of trying to uncover the soul. And he disappointed his body. He became an ascetic and he did some really is really hard himself for about six years. He he'd go around living on moss and cow dung and dressing in animal and the tree bark or owl feathers, not taking a bath or even washing the dirt off his hair. He would eat like a grain of rice a day. And there were there were times when there's at least one time when he was taken for dead or mistaken for dead and or dying. And he said, he said, no matter what anybody's tried in the past, what they may try today or what they may try in the future, nobody can do better, can try harder than I have. They can, they can equal me, but nobody can do better. And still he hadn't found it. He had didn't have this, this, this freedom that he wanted, this freedom from old age, sickness and death. And this is a guy he's I can kind of imagine him sitting there at 35 years old. He said, I walked away from this palace and the beautiful wife and this young son I haven't seen in six years looking for enlightenment and I haven't found it by mastering the body and I haven't found it by mastering the mind. Is it possible? Maybe I can't do this. And while he was thinking this, he thought back to an incident that happened when he's a young, young, just a young prince, just five years old, something like that. His nurses left him alone for a while and then they came back and they were at a festival and the nurses were kind of looking outside the tent, see all the colors in the pageantry and stuff like that. And young Gotama, Prince Gotama was sitting inside. When they came back, he was sitting cross-legged and he was in the first jhana, he was in meditation. The first jhana is the first of these eight steps. And he remembered back, he said, you know, that was pretty good. It wasn't painful. I've been doing painful things for a long time. It was actually kind of nice. How about if I take what I know about the body and what I know about the mind, how about if I just sit down and apply both of those things. So he sat down and he concentrated the mind and went through various, he found out various things during the first part of the night. And then in the last watch, you know, somewhere between like two o'clock and dawn, he was thinking about, he was thinking about the body and thoughts and these things, not with any reference to trying to overcome them, but just looking at how they were. He knew what it was to suffer for the sake of suffering, hoping that he could by enough suffering, he could unclog the pipelines and free the soul or whatever particular doctrine he had. That night, this night, he was doing something different. He was just looking at suffering for what it is, for just trying to understand it as it was. And by the time the morning star twinkled, he had it figured out. He was enlightened. He's the Buddha. Early in the night, he saw his past lives and then later he got to figure out how he could look at somebody else and figure out what their lives were. But, you know, in the last night, last watch of the night, he figured out what we now know is the Four Noble Truths and a few other things. So he decided after he sat around for a few weeks, just kind of contemplating what he had done, what he'd found out, he decided he was going to go and teach. He wasn't sure at first he was going to abuse. Maybe nobody's going to understand this. But the way the suitors have it, they spice it up and when the gods comes down, it convinces them to teach. But that's still up to the Buddha to decide who should he teach, who can understand this. So he could have gone back to his father's palace where all the Brahmins were and he could have gone to find the greatest philosopher around. He didn't do that. He went and he said, who among the people that I know, there are seekers, could understand this. So he first thought of his two meditation teachers. They had died since he left them. And then he thought of the five aesthetics who were with him, had been with him for the most of the last six years. And he said, I think they'll know. They weren't with him because they thought the Buddha had gone soft when he accepted a solid food after six years of ascetic practices. So he found his old students. And here we, not his old students, his old spiritual friends. These guys were the closest people he had, spiritual friends and the people that he thought were most likely to understand this. So what he did was he picked practitioners. Suddhas kind of let us figure this out for ourselves. He didn't go to philosophers. Okay. He went to people who had been looking and disciplining themselves, thinking that he had something that could turn the key for them. So he found them. And the first lesson he taught, the first term he taught was the Four Noble Truths. This is all leading up to anata. So first he taught how suffering, the first noble truth was taught about how suffering can appear in every corner of our lives, even when we're not looking for it or we don't expect it. It's easy to say that suffering is watching the world. Watching your parents die or being very sick. It's not so easy to say that suffering is finishing the beer after mowing the lawn and wishing you had another one. That's suffering too. Or suffering is having something very good happen and wishing you had more. All these little things we might not call suffering are suffering. And so the Buddha said the first noble truth was there is suffering. He didn't say that life is suffering. He said that suffering is what I'm dealing with. If life were suffering, then there'd be no way out in this life. And that's what he found. So life was suffering. And at the same time he said that the suffering had to be understood. So that's kind of the part that people we like to forget about the first noble truth. Is that you have to understand suffering. And by that he means pay attention to it and not turn away from it. So if you're sitting and your knee hurts or something like that, you say well I'm sure I'd meditate better if my knee weren't hurting so I'll move. Well maybe the Buddha would say no that's suffering. You need to don't hurt yourself but understand the nature of that suffering. Sitting there with your knee hurting just to get it out is not understanding suffering. That's his suffering. The Buddha did that big time for six years and he said that's not the way. The key, the difference was looking at the suffering and understanding it for what it was. Then the second noble truth is tracing all the suffering back to one source. And it wasn't being ununited with a cosmic being or anything like that. It was craving or thirst actually. The word the Buddha used was tanha which is thirst. I think that's an interesting word. If you think back thirst can mean a lot of things. It can mean standing in the hot sun and having your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth and you really know you're thirsty. And thirst can also be just picking up a cup of coffee and setting it down before you even know you did anything. So it's that whole spectrum. It's that whole spectrum and all of it is thirst. The stuff like picking up a cup of coffee and putting it down. We might not recognize it but it's there and operates on this subtle level. And all of that it's not just this grade B and above suffering that the Buddha was about. He was after all of it. And that meant looking at all of the thirst, all of the craving. And then the third noble truth. Now remember that only a few days before, only a few weeks before he was wondering if enlightenment was possible at all. And he might have been and now he's saying yes it is. He's found the way. Then the third noble truth he said is that there is a way to do this. This is not a thing that's given by grace or that you have to be lucky or only by birth or whatever. There's a method. There's a way to achieve this enlightenment. And then the fourth noble truth is actually laid out the way. And that's called the eightfold path. And it's right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration. And I mentioned those because I want to talk about right view a little bit here too. When the Buddha says right view or right this or right and this context, it's not right in the sense of orthodox or correct. It's really easy for us to it's this, you know, it's really easy for us to think that that's what right means. We're expecting orthodox, heterodox and we're expecting that kind of lineup. Sama, which is Samadhi, right view means like appropriate or thoroughgoing or effective or something like that. It's so what so it's when the Buddha is talking about right views about or other things, it's not that there's a correct doctrine in a wrong doctrine that he's talking about. He's here and he says he's not saying I'm going to tell you the I'm spoiling my talk. You're supposed to think figure this out in 20 minutes. But anyway, he's this isn't about telling what the correct doctrine is. This is about giving you the right tools to achieve this liberation. So all of the Buddha's thoughts about about views were formulated around how effective they were in getting his teachings across rather than about trying to teach you some cosmological truth. So after the first sermon, one of the guys, one of these five monks actually got a little bit of it. I think he got to a stream mentor. He saw the first his first glimpse of of a liberation. And actually, that was the guy that we told you about when the Buddha was like eight days old or whatever it was one of the guys that says he's going to be a Buddha. That was the same guy, Kondanya. So he was with him, hanging out with him in the in the forest for six years. One of the guys this walk off what a disappointment. This guy ate rice and bread. And anyway, here he is one of the first guys to get the first taste. But there was only a taste and there's only one out of the five. So in a few days, and this is the Buddha Buddha laid it all out here, the Four Noble Truths. That's that's the main stuff. He wasn't holding back. Wasn't saying this is just the warm up. There's better stuff coming. So what what was going on? I mean, was it the you know, why weren't these guys enlightened? So then he gave the his second teaching a few days later, which is the Anatha Lankana Suta, the Suta on the Anatha characteristics. So we got to ask ourselves, was the Buddha adding something to the teaching? I mean, it was something he said, Oh, there's really a fifth noble truth, but I'm going to call it the nada on kana Suta. I mean, was there something missing? Was he adding something to the teaching? Or was he taking something away that was an impediment to seeing the teaching? And I think it's so let's let's see, this is gone. And we'll just read the suit in here. He says, so the Buddha is in this game refuge, and he's talking to these five, five ascetics. He says, form monks, by that he means physical and material form, form monks is not self. If form were the self, this form would not lend itself to disease, decay, unhappiness, unsatisfactoriness, whatever, it would be possible to say with regard to form, let this form be thus, let this form be not thus. But precisely because form is not self, form lends itself to disease. And it is not possible to say with regard to form, let this form be thus, let this form be not thus. So let me try and paraphrase this. He says, if form were self, I'd have more control over it. I can say, okay, my teeth aren't going to be loose this week, not at all, or time for the dysentery to stop, whatever. But he says, no, it doesn't work that way. He says, you can't do anything about it. Some things you can. If you're standing under the hot sun, you can move under the shade, et cetera, but you're not going to stop yourself from getting sick, from getting old, et cetera. So he says form in this, he says, he says something that's that fickle, that's that, that the changes as much as this does and is unsatisfactoriness, that doesn't deserve to be called self. Does it? He didn't say that there's no self. He just says, that doesn't deserve to be called self. Then later in the sudah, he says, and how do you conceive this monks is material form permanent or impermanent. And they all say impermanent Lord. He says, but is it fitting to regard what is impermanent, unpleasant and subject to change as this is me, this is mine, this is who I am. This is no Lord. So he's kind of leading the, leading the monks somewhere. Now this, I think was Socrates that had a, a dialogue with a slave boy or something like that. And by asking him a bunch of clever questions, prove that the slave boy had an intuitive understanding that the square root of two was an irrational number, something like that. I mean, I don't know if it's Socrates, somebody, somebody did that, somebody did something like that. And you kind of get the idea that, I mean, that was a great trick, right? But you kind of got the idea that the slave boy wasn't any better for it. Um, it was not like he was convinced to want home and felt, oh wow, I really understood something today. I don't think the Buddha was trying to do that with the monks. He's not trying to trick these guys into believing something. I think he's trying to say, now let's look here. We're, we're, we're going to look at form right now and we're just going to acknowledge, we're not going to say anything about, oh, I have to subdue this form. This form is staying in between me and the transcendental soul or something. We're going to talk about what we can feel and what we experience. And he says, and he says, and that that's changes. You can't, it changes on its own. You can't do a whole lot about it. And a lot of the time it's very unpleasant. Is that what you want to call soul, the highest goal? Well, no, I guess not. Then the Buddha over the course of the suit, it does this with four other categories. He talks about, um, perception of feelings, feelings, uh, perception, like seeing things, um, hearing things. Mental formations and, um, consciousness itself. And those five categories, um, it's the categories themselves aren't that important to us. I mean, here, here's where the, uh, we choose that we're on the anatomy for beginners track and the advanced studies kind of veers off into the details. Um, a lot of you know that this is the, the five condas or aggregates, and those are fearsome things because, uh, they have all this philosophical baggage associated with them. And, um, well, I mean, later generations of, you know, commentators on the suitas and, uh, they came up with, uh, let's see, what is it? 50 different kinds of mental formations and 89 classes of consciousness. And I think there's 57 kinds of joy, four of which are unwholesome. I mean, it's lists upon lists upon lists. And, um, and then you can go off and say, well, I mean, you can really get off into the weeds here and not go anywhere. But if the Buddha wanted to talk like that, it would have found a philosopher. And these guys, he's talking with these guys who have been standing on one leg for four weeks at a time or standing under the hot sun with, uh, fires on four sides of them. I mean, these are practical guys. Um, he's talking, he's pointing to the reality of their, their bodies and their minds and their thoughts as they know them. In fact, you could, uh, something that sometimes the Buddha actually uses other categories. Sometimes he just uses a twofold petition, uh, uh, body and form, nama and rupa. Um, sometimes that there's a whole section of the suitors that, um, I'm not the suitors of the, the, the canon that treats things in a threefold petition. Um, the number, the, the, for us tonight and not for beginners, the, uh, the, the, the, the, the, the, the classifications aren't important. What's, what is important is what the Buddha was doing is he was in a way that made sense to him and his audience. He was systematically going through all of anything we could know and saying, is it impermanent? Is it satisfactory? Etc. Um, and in fact, one of the words, the word that the Buddha used at the time for what we translated as aggregates was really a, really a fairly homey folksy word. It meant, uh, like the back of a shoulder, not like a tree trunk and like a heap. And he distinguished it by calling it the, uh, uh, the, the, the condors of, of clinging. But it was still a condo, still this very folksy term. And I think what he's trying to do was, uh, bring this, was use words that were, uh, really familiar to people and it didn't have a lot of, uh, about a heavyweight spin or anything like that. Just trying to make, okay, we're talking about something we all know about here. So what kind of heaps was the Buddha talking about? Well, you can think, well, they're really a collective nouns, like a team or a committee, like the, so there's a, like a team, the 49ers. There is a team that's the 49ers, but if you look closely at it, they're 11 guys, but they're always coming and going to from people on the field at the same time. Maybe that's what he's talking about. And he said, well, gee, maybe that makes sense. You know, we know that the cells in the body turn over every seven years or so. And there are people that think that the mind is really a bunch of small mini minds, the society of mind theory, if you've ever heard of that, this doing things and maybe, maybe that's what the Buddha was talking about, but that's not what we see when we actually look. Um, what we actually, what we see is, um, uh, if we look at say, uh, need the turdiness or something like that, or the body will, will tend, you know, this from your own, from your own meditation will be, you'll be meditating all of a sudden you'll, you'll shift and you'll notice the pain in the knee. You're not noticing at the time, if you look carefully, you're not thinking about your sit bones and the cushion or about your breath or about your head or anything else. You may switch very quickly between those. Uh, but it's at one time it's the pain in the knee and it might not be the knee. It might be this thing floating in space that is ultimately hot and cold or feels hard right now or feels prickly or something like that. When you look at it, the kind of the nenus disappears. Um, you look closely enough at it, even your own ownership can kind of just, you know, it's like there's, there's pain there, but it's somebody else's pain. Uh, you can kind of disidentify with the pain. And that's, I think what the Buddha was talking about heaps in that sentence, a sense of, um, like a classification scheme, more like pigeonholes. These are names that these are the only reality they have. I mean, there's only like one thing happening at a time. The only reality they have is the one that we impute to it by our ideas that, um, that we're assuming it's very conventional, very, you know, it's just kind of baked into us. We think we have a body. Uh, and I think it's interesting that the little kids have to learn that they don't look, you know, this is, you know, I think they, uh, have to have to figure out that this, this toe they're sucking on is really part of them. And, uh, they, they kind of have to learn that when they're a person and then they can move all these things together. And then we get, we get to the meditation here in the forties or fifties and we have to try to unlearn some of this stuff. So I think it was a second kind of heap that the Buddha was talking about. And, um, I want to mention a few things about, about noting now. I mean, we're talking about talking about the meditation. First, if we're looking at something, you try, you can try and give it a transparent label, you know, like a little label you get in a store. It's a, it's clear. It just says, you know, CD 1799 or whatever. It doesn't block anything. It just kind of labels it. So when you, if you're, uh, going to be labeling, uh, labeling something or giving it a little name as it comes up, you can do that in the sense not to obscure it or to change its identity, uh, but to, um, but as a device to make, to, to draw your attention to it and know when you're, when you're paying attention to something and when you're not, it's very helpful. Um, I've trained with, uh, meditation teachers. You come in and they ask you to go through as many of the four foundations of mindfulness as you can. Gil's been talking about those and say, what happened? Did you note it? And what happened then? And you'd be amazed. I mean, those are really hard questions. You get in there and you realize, no, I'm just kind of remembering what happened. And I'm trying to, trying to, uh, uh, tell this teacher at the moment what, and, uh, what was going on. But if you, um, if you sit down with the intention of saying, I want to know what's going on as it goes on and know about it in most atomic terms, that kind of sharpens your practice. So, um, instead of saying pain, you may say, no, that's a construct. You say, okay, no, it's, it's hard and it's hot or it's cold and it's moving, it's prickling, moving fast. Those, those are the, that's the level at which the Buddha was asking, um, asking the ascetics and asking us, um, to look at it. You don't have to worry about if you're getting the perfect label, and saying, uh, yes or again or this, that's okay. That's okay. If it kept, if it keeps you current with what's going on, don't get stuck with being too discursive or worrying about the perfect label. Just the fact of being interested in what's going on is going to make the labeling easier for you and more appropriate. And, um, you get to, you get into the labels come easier and easier instead of, you know, a couple times a minute, it'd be every couple seconds and then more and more. But, you know, don't get hung up on it if you're not, if you're not getting them that day. Just, uh, it's, it's a, it's a tool to let you know when you're not doing it as well as anything else. Um, and then this, this anything you can do to get your interest up, like paying attention like this, like I said, paying attention to what happens, do I label it and what happens after that. If your interest is up, your energy is up and I'll keep you from getting dopey and sleeping and, and drifting away. Okay. So when you do this, you don't need to use these five con you can use the four foundations of mindfulness for your mail. That's why they're there is for meditation practice. The idea isn't that we have the correct categories. We're, we're, the idea is to be naturalists, but not taxonomists. Okay. So if, um, if the taxonomy helps, that's fine, but mostly we want to see what's going on. Uh, so if you look closely at that right knee chain pain, you'll see the things change and sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly. Um, and more importantly, the closer you look, the less it seems, you know, and set you think if you look really closely, you're going to find, you're going to find out what that knee really is. The closer you look, the less it looks like there's a knee there more. It looks like little prickles moving around or something like that. Kind of get the idea that there's less there than meets the eye. And that's part of why we do the meditation. That's why the Buddha was calling the ascetics back to what, not what they expected to find or what they were going to find underneath, but just to look at the phenomena themselves. Um, you can do the same thing with thoughts. I mean, you may find that if you just say, I'm sad, just sad, sad that that fact gives the sadness, less power over you. I mean, you may find that you're still very sad about your father dying or, or whatever, but just knowing that you're sad and say, Oh, I'm sad rather than have this, you know, be front and center and say, Oh, the world is horrible. That that can give you a little bit of freedom as well. So this is, um, what the Buddha taught. This is what the Buddha taught us to do. And I think this is what he was talking about with the monks. So let's go back to the pseudo says, how do you conceive this monks is material form, permanent or impermanent, impermanent Lord, but is it fitting to regard, uh, what is permanent, unpleasant and subject to change as this is me, this is mine, this is who I am. No Lord. And I think then this is the suit is payload. He says, seeing thus the well-instructed disciple of the noble ones grows disenchanted with the body, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with perception, disenchanted with fabrications, disenchanted with consciousness, disenchanted. He becomes fully dispassionate through dispassion. He is fully released. He discerns birth has ended. The holy life is fulfilled. The task is done. So I think it's a seeing for himself that the Buddha, that's what he wanted. When the monks, the ascetics had heard the four, the four noble truths, if they were still looking at things in terms of this is me, this is mine, this is who I am, they weren't going to get it. Uh, I think what the Buddha needed to do and what he did in the second suit was, was get him to look past that. So, um, you know, if you can stop identifying with your thoughts, with your bodies or your feelings, then you can look at suffering for what it is. It's not something that's happening to you. It's not something you're doing so that you can be united with your soul. There's something going on. That's beat. That's gets clouded by, or is beyond our stories about it. So drop the stories and look directly at what's going on. And I think that that's where that's, you know, that's how the Buddha used to not, it was at not as no self, but as not self. It was an admonition as a training tool, uh, for the monks. It wasn't something to be memorized or thought about. Those are more concepts and you're just going to get in the way. We have plenty of concepts. The Buddha wanted us to, to drop those. So that is what I think the, think how I think the Buddha used to Nada. Um, you may think that it's kind of splitting hairs to say that the Buddha never said that there was no soul, but people actually asked him, he says, well, is there a soul? Is there not a soul? It's got to be one of the two things, or is there both a soul and not a soul or neither soul. He wouldn't go there. He, um, basically there, uh, that basically some of the things that can happen with wrong views, even like there is no soul, Buddha wouldn't get into that. You said, if you have a doctrine and you disagree about it with somebody else, that's just getting in the way of your, of your, your meditation. Even if you're right, it doesn't matter if you're right. The fact that you're, uh, contentious or whatever is, is getting in the way of your meditation. He says, if you have a, if you have a belief and it's the wrong belief, it can, uh, lead you to, um, it can sabotage your practice. If you say there is no soul, then you say, oh, there's no soul. Then there's no rebirth and there's no karma. Then why should I practice? That was no good either. So the Buddha was not, he was, he was, uh, you know, it was really hard on people who tried to pin him into a box and say, well, is there a soul? Is there not a soul? What happens to the Buddha after a death, after his death? And the reason was not that he didn't want to tell people, but because those weren't the things that were going to help them, um, on their practice. And that's one of the things I like about this, the way that the, about this practice is that it's all so practical and so compassionate at once. It's, um, not trying to come up with the greatest philosophy. We're just trying to come up with the best tools, um, to get, uh, to get out of, out from under old age, sickness and death. So that's what I had to say about Anatta for beginners. And other questions, observations? I'd like to talk as just a group, you know, people, they're going to join in and answer one or another. We don't always get a chance to just to sit and talk like, you know, like this. So, you know, Shai, I'll give you a few minutes and we'll sit and nothing happens. The exercise of trying to, to go through and say, okay, I definitely believe that there is this meaning. And then saying, well, where is it? What is it? And sort of pressing the issue in a way that it doesn't speak is a very, very alienating experience. Because what I found is that you cannot find the way it is. There is no thing. Unless you say it's the, the space in the middle of the form of everything else. I am exactly only that which is not, not being in, therefore I'm infinitely small. It gets very difficult to go into with words, but you keep looking for it. It's not the bottom, it's not the bottom. It's not the bank account number. It's not the belief that you have. What is it? It keeps on trying to sneak back in, too. But it's obviously true that I exist. There's absolutely, you know, anything is true, you know, that I know for sure, of course. Right. Right. It's a very tricky thing. It's very surprising. Yeah, I think the good thing is that we can see parts of it and then repeat that experience again and deepen it. And well, it's also very liberating because if you really do come to the conclusion that this thing is a construct and there's no more than a construct, and there is no need to be the locus of suffering. Yeah. And I wonder, have you ever run into trying to explain a lot of, you know, just to somebody in a more casual way and find out that there's a strong negative reaction. I don't have a specific number, but I can believe that, you know, people. What are you talking about? Of course, of course the Buddha said this, or of course the Buddha said we're all one, or the Buddha said this. And there's a people think they have all kinds of ideas about what the Buddha said. Is that what you're talking about? Just more thinking of an instance where I was talking with my wife and I said, you know, I don't think I exist. And that's a rather inward-faced way. And so we try to not put it in the end of the face. And that's probably why I think it was met with sort of what they're being taken aback and sort of a hostile way, because it implies either the data of the place. And perhaps I was just very in skillful in certain instances in trying to discuss the findings. Yeah. You know, one of the things about the Buddha is he was just one of the reasons he's so effective as a teacher is he knew how to approach the issue with any given audience. You know, and I mean, with these these ascetics have been in the woods for with them for years, he approached it another one way. And other people he did approach it another like once he had a, it was one of his monks, couldn't remember a two line chant. And his brother, his older brother, dumb brother, can't remember an old two line chant. He wanted to get him kicked out of the order. He says, this guy's never going to make it as a monk. But the Buddha knew that this guy had spent a lot of work in a previous life working on defilements of the body or something like that. So he had this guy stand out in an open field with a white cloth in his hand. And this move it around in his hand and he started getting sweaty and dirty and all that guy got enlightened. And he's the Buddha picked the right thing. Then of course, this guy went back and his big brother had his words. But the Buddha was always, you know, could always pick what was appropriate and all that. And sometimes it's sometimes you just got to let it lie, you know, sometimes you just got to let it lie too. I don't know. It's a hard one. Oh, I'm sorry. I was just thinking about the kind of popular phrasing. Like hurts, everything changes, don't take it personally. And it'll take it personally. And it's sort of a different life. But I think that's what we're used to also. So we think that no things are happening because we're here to receive it. But, you know, and just to be able to feel like, oh, I'm not going to take this personally. It's a huge difference in terms of how. I mean, yes, I'm this, you know, I'm excuse me, I'm thinking of my own reactions to that, you know, and well, yes, of course, that's right. How could I possibly disagree? And I think, yeah, and I have to have boundaries to, you know, I have to, you know, I'm still trying to learn this Asian wisdom and then I still have to learn, still have to get along with my Western self here. And that's where I think some of the stuff gets really interesting is where you take the teachings and you try and mix them in with, well, how do I take this off the cushion or into the office or whatever? And that's when it gets really hard, I think. Well, we could sit for a few minutes until.ique have more to do with, you know. And well, OK, the Darmah teacher said that and then said something. She came back in Thailand. that was kind of amazed that in the whole time she was there no one really wanted to know her opinion. That whole idea of that you have an opinion or that they cared about your opinion or that you were, but that's where I saw a good part of myself, is that this attachment to what you think. The beliefs might be the thing that we identified with most closely, but it's definitely something to identify. We have a tendency to attach the other as opposed to attachment to our self. Very difficult to for some reason to attach to our self. We have to find it seems something we can physically see and be like another person, another thing and attach to that. All these concepts that we have been taught, I have been taught all my life about how to do, how not to do, what to do, what not to do. It seems to all structure away from me, myself, my existence. And so we attach to something else that looks nice and you personalize into that whether it's good or bad. An argument, a conflict, a road rage, we personalize into it as opposed to, gee he was sad. Just leave it at that and become within our self or myself. And frankly I'm learning this from being here and listening to wonderful teachers and therapists that I have, those that are reading that I've been doing, workshop. I can find that I can be within myself, be present myself. And I've amazed this me because I would spend my time, a scenario, counting sheep at night. I would build this building, every little thing, every screw for the door, all the little pieces of wood, all night long. Maybe take a little nap, wake up, a little nap, wake up. And I still do that. I mean I still don't sleep all night. But now I can be with myself and quiet of mine. And it's kind of amazing. I am me. I am alive. I am existing. I am great. Wonderful. And the concepts I have, but I can release them. I have a difficult time with them. But I can release them slowly. And the attachments I can also release. I'd like to know more. I hope I can do it. Yeah, well I think the bad news is that it's not something you can agree with and then do. That's why I took the Buddha to get us out of this. It wasn't just you read a book. Those help. But when it really gets tough, the stuff you read in the book isn't going to do it. But I think it's the stuff you do in the pillow or practicing life you get to get yourself. Oh, I can do this. And I'm not quite so identified with it. I think it's the experiential angle of it. Maybe I'm just talking, maybe this is just me. The experiential angle of it is what really takes it for me to make it real. You may not know. It's common wisdom. You come back from a retreat and you don't know what you got. It'll show up in six months or a year and you won't know it's from that retreat. It just kind of happens. But I think it's, like I said, the experiential angle.
